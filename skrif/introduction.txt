Hypoxic conditions in aquatic systems are a growing problem worldwide, and such events can occur at seasonal, local, and even at global and geological scales (Rabalais et al. 2001, 2010, Diaz and Rosenberg 2008, Levin et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2010, Caswell and Frid 2017, Alosairi et al. 2021). Hypoxic conditions  commonly arise because of anthropogenic eutrophication (Malone and Newton 2020), where an ecosystem becomes overflowed with nutrient stressors (sewage, waste, fertilizers, or other organic material). The subsequent usage of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus by macrophytes, phytoplankton and bacteria in biological processes may require more oxygen than the system can supply, leading to hypoxic (or anoxic) conditions which are lethal or sub-lethal to pelagic and benthic organisms and other metazoans. Ecosystem recovery can take years, even decades or longer (Ærtebjerg et al. 2003, Diaz and Rosenberg 2008, Jones and Schmitz 2009, Borja et al. 2010, Malone and Newton 2020, Le Moal, Gascuel-Odoux et al. 2019). 

There are three main types of hypoxic conditions: seasonal, episodic (“following flooding”) and permanent (Levin et al. 2009). Hypoxic conditions commonly occur when water columns become stratified, which prevents oxygenated surface waters from mixing with lower-oxygen water near the bottom. Various taxa display differing thresholds for tolerance of low oxygen conditions (Vaquer-Sunyer & Duarte 2008, Belley et al. 2010) but such responses also depend on size of the affected area and duration of exposure (Levin et al. 2009). Wijnhoven et al. 2010 defined hypoxia (low oxygen) as O2<3 mg/l but anoxia (no oxygen) at O2<0.5 mg/l, whereas Rabalais et al. (2010) defined hypoxic conditions as O2<2 mg/l. Vaquer-Sunyer & Duarte (2008) found that the common definition of 2 mg O2/l as hypoxic was below empirical sub-lethal and lethal O2 thresholds for 50% the species tested, which implied that past, present and future distribution of hypoxic impacts on marine life generally have been underestimated.  

Hypoxic conditions can be permanent, which makes it difficult for benthic animals to re-establish (Wijnhoven et al. 2010, Belley et al. 2010, Raman et al. 2015) but can also occur seasonally in water bodies which are largely land-locked or have relatively narrow outlets relative to their volume.  Examples include estuaries, fjords, lagoons, or even land-locked oceans (e.g. Baltic and Black seas) which have relatively limited water exchange with sources of oxygenated water and relatively long residence times (Levin et al. 2009). To date, many of the fjord-like hypoxic ecosystems studied so far with respect to benthic fauna are estuaries with seasonal hypoxia, i.e. transition zones where freshwater from land and seawater mix with the occasional hyper abundance of fresh or saline conditions leading to stratifications (with seasonal nutrient or salinity overflows) and subsequent oxygen depletion, but also periods of recovery in between the seasonal stress (Leon-Morales and Vargas 1998, Como and Magni 2009, Yoshino et al. 2010, Díaz-Asencio et al. 2015). Studies of one-time hypoxic events (one-time hypoxic conditions with subsequent recovery for years without repeated hypoxic stressors), are relatively rare for marine/saline fjords, especially in the Northern Hemisphere (Micaroni et al. 2021). They are commonly associated with anthropogenic eutrophication although such events might also arise due to natural phases of seasonal cycles (Josefson & Widbom 1988, Fallesen et al. 2000, Nilsson & Rosenberg 2000, Hansen et al. 2002). 

In the winter of 2012-2013, a massive hypoxic event occurred in Kolgrafarfjörður fjord, West-Iceland (Fig. 1). Approximately 300 thousand tonnes (~70% of the Icelandic spawning stock) of herring (Clupea harengus) entered the semi-enclosed 6 km long fjord as part of their natural overwintering behaviour (Óskarsson et al. 2018, Jónsson et al. 2009). A combination of oxygen consumption by the colossal quantity of herring in the 0.2 km3 fjord (this amount of herring in the fjord might lower the oxygen concentrations to hypoxic levels in a few hours (Óskarsson et al. 2018)), unusually calm and cold weather and surface ice formation limiting oxygen exchange with the air, along with the semi-enclosed nature of the fjord, caused a mass fish kill of a cumulative total 55 thousand tonnes of herring in two separate occasions six weeks apart (hereafter herring event). The full volume of dead herring in Kolgrafarfjörður in winter 2012-2013 equated to 180 million individuals, was of similar magnitude as Iceland’s entire allowable herring catch in the 2012-2013 fishing season (Óskarsson et al. 2018, Jónsson et al. 2019). Measurements of oxygen saturation in the fjord in the days following the mass fish kill incidents was as low oxygen levels as 1.1 ml/L near the bottom (Óskarsson et al. 2018). 

The magnitude of the fish death was clearly visible, as approximately 7 thousand tons of herring washed ashore during the later incident (Fig. 2). The immediate consequences for the benthic fauna were less clear, although numerous dead invertebrates of diverse taxa also washed ashore along with the dead herring (Stefánsson and von Schmalensee 2013). Given the low oxygen levels near the bottom of the fjord during the hypoxic conditions that led to the fish kills (Óskarsson et al. 2018), it is likely that the benthic fauna was also influenced at that time. In the weeks and months that followed, the benthic ecosystem experienced additional environmental stress, as thousands of tons of decomposing herring caused eutrophication and probably further hypoxia in the fjord, at least near the bottom. 

The herring event and following eutrophication in Kolgrafarfjörður in winter 2012-2013 was a one-time incident, as no further fish kills has occurred there since. The herring death thus presented a unique opportunity to follow the recovery of the benthic ecosystem in the years after the event. Mass fish kills are increasing worldwide, with numerous negative consequences (La & Cooke 2011, Alosairi et al. 2021). Understanding the effects such events can have on other species is therefore of the utmost importance.    

This study began immediately after the herring deaths and sampling ran six years from 2013-2017. The  aim was twofold: 1) Estimate the effects of the hypoxia and eutrophic conditions on the benthos of Kolgrafarfjörður, by comparing our data from 2013-2017 to a dataset using the same sampling stations from 1999 (Ingólfsson 1999); 2) Quantify how species composition and number of individual macrofauna recover after the environmental shock event and estimate the time period needed until full recovery. Specifically, we looked at the emergence of species capable of decomposing the herring mass under eutrophic and hypoxic conditions and subsequently how they were replaced by pioneer species that normally live in undisturbed conditions. Species sensitive to low oxygen levels were also given special attention. 

 

Study area 

Kolgrafarfjörður (64°57′16″N 23°07′15″W) is a semi-enclosed fjord which opens north to the Breiðafjörður bay in West Iceland (Fig. 1). It has a surface area of ~10 km2, volume 0.2 km3, and maximum depth of 42 m (Óskarsson et al. 2018). A 230 m long bridge with a 150 m effective opening and a causeway was built in 2004 at the mouth of the fjord. That narrowed the opening of the fjord, but the design allowed for an approximately the same exchange of water under the bridge as before the construction. Measurements after the construction confirmed that the amplitude and timing of the tides are similar inside and outside of the bridge (Mannvit 2011), with the tide inside of Kolgrafarfjörður delayed by 18 minutes relative to the outside waters. The exchange of seawater in Kolgrafarfjörður is almost exclusively driven by the tides, with minor effects of e.g. wind and air pressure (Jónsson et al. 2019). There is a strong tidal current of up to at least 7 knots (3.6 m/s) under the bridge between low and high tide (Óskarsson et al. 2018). The main direction of the current inside Kolgrafarfjörður is south along the west side of the fjord and out towards the bridge along the middle and east coast. Estimated flushing time of the fjord is 2.6 days at spring tide and 6.7 days at neap tide. Freshwater inflow to the fjord is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than the flow under the bridge. Generally, stratification in Kolgrafarfjörður is not expected to be common or important, although during calm and cold weather conditions, the freshwater runoff to Kolgrafarfjörður can create a less dense and colder surface layer, which may facilitate the formation of a thin layer of sea ice and hence limit the ocean-atmosphere exchange of oxygen (Jónsson et al. 2019). Anthropogenic influences on nutrients of the fjord are considered insignificant, as this is a rural area and only two small farms are situated at the fjord, although the fjord is occasionally entered by smaller fishing vessels. The fjord is saline despite freshwater input from nearby mountains. 

Following the mass herring death in the winter 2012/2013, considerable effort was put into research to try to understand the role of different physical parameters in the herring event, including measurements of currents, wind, sea-level, temperature, salinity and oxygen at various positions and depths (see Óskarsson et al. 2018 and Jónsson et al. 2019).
