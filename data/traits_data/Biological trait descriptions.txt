Morphology (m),Exoskeleton,Body is covered or encased in either a thin chitinous layer or calcium carbonate shell.
Morphology (m),Crustose,Body is hard and forms a thin layer over the substratum or another organism.
Morphology (m),Cushion,Body is soft and forms a cushion-like layer over the substratum or another organism.
Morphology (m),Stalked,Body is erect and typically attached.

Lifespan (l),More_than_10,The maximum reported lifespan (years) of the adult stage of the taxon.
Egg development location (ed),Asexual,Can reproduce asexually, either by fragmentation, budding, epitoky, etc.
Egg development location (ed),Sexual_pelagic,Eggs are released into the water column.
Egg development location (ed),Sexual_benthic,Eggs are released onto/into the seabed, either free or attached, e.g. by mucous.
Egg development location (ed),Sexual_brooded,Fertilised eggs are maintained by adult for protection, either within parental tube or body cavity.
Larva development location (ld),Pelagic_planktotrophic,Larvae feed on plankton and spend a relatively long time in the water column.
Larva development location (ld),Pelagic_lecithotrophic,Larvae feed on yolk reserves and spend a relatively short time in the water column.
Larva development location (ld),Benthic_direct,Larval stage missing (eggs develop directly into juveniles) or larvae are limited to the seabed.
Living habit (lh),Tube_dwelling,Adults live in a tube, which may be lined with sand, mucus or calcium carbonate.
Living habit (lh),Burrow_dwelling,Adults live in a permanent or temporary burrow.
Living habit (lh),Free_living,Adults do not inhabit a restrictive structure. Able to move freely within and/or on sediments.
Living habit (lh),Crevice_hole_under_stones,Adults typically cryptic and inhabit spaces within coarse/rock substrate or algal holdfasts.
Living habit (lh),Epi_endo_biotic,Adults live on or in another organism.
Living habit (lh),Attached_to_substratum,Adults are attached to coarse substrate or rock.
Sediment position (sp),Surface,Adults live on or just above the seabed.
Sediment position (sp),Shallow_infauna_0_to_5cm,Adults live below sediment surface between 0 and 5 cm depth.
Sediment position (sp),Mid_depth_infauna_5_to_10cm,Adults live below sediment surface between 5 and 10 cm depth.
Sediment position (sp),Deep_infauna_more_than_10cm,Adults live below sediment surface at greater than 10 cm depth.
Feeding mode (f),Suspension,Feeds on particulate food resources suspended in the water column.
Feeding mode (f),Surface_deposit,Feeds on detritus (including algal material) on the sediment surface.
Feeding mode (f),Subsurface_deposit,Feeds on detritus located within the sediment matrix.
Feeding mode (f),Scavenger,Feeds on dead animals (carrion).
Feeding mode (f),Predator,Actively predates on animals (including small zooplankton).
Feeding mode (f),Parasite,Derives nutrition from its host organism.
Mobility (mob),Sessile,Adults have little or no mobility. Typically attached or lives in (semi-) permanent burrow/tube.
Mobility (mob),Swim,Adults actively swim in the water column (many return to the bed when not feeding).
Mobility (mob),Crawl_creep_climb,Adults capable of some (typically limited) movement along the sediment or rock surface.
Mobility (mob),Burrower,Adults capable of active movement within the sediment matrix.
Bioturbation mode (b),Diffusive_mixing,Vertical and horizontal redistribution of sediment and/or other particles.
Bioturbation mode (b),Surface_deposition,Deposition of particles at sediment surface, e.g. from defecation or egestion (pseudofaeces).
Bioturbation mode (b),Upward_conveyor,Translocation of particles from depth to sediment surface, e.g. during sub-surface deposit-feeding.
Bioturbation mode (b),Downward_conveyor,The subduction of particles from sediment surface to depth, e.g. by feeding and/or defecation.
Bioturbation mode (b),None,Does not have any bioturbative capacity.
