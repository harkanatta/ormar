8                             Feeds on detritus (including algal material) on the sediment surface.
9                            The maximum reported lifespan (years) of the adult stage of the taxon.
10              Larvae feed on yolk reserves and spend a relatively short time in the water column.
11                                                  Adults live in a permanent or temporary burrow.
12                        External tissue is soft and not covered by any form of protective casing.
13 Adults have little or no mobility. Typically attached or lives in (semi-) permanent burrow/tube.
14                                    Adults live below sediment surface between 5 and 10 cm depth.
15                                  Adults live below sediment surface at greater than 10 cm depth.
16                                     Adults live below sediment surface between 0 and 5 cm depth.
17                   The maximum size (mm) that the taxon is known to reach during the adult stage.
