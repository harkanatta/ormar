4                                                     Deposition of particles at sediment surface
5                                                          Eggs are released onto/into the seabed
6                                          Fertilised eggs are maintained by adult for protection
7                           Feeds on detritus (including algal material) on the sediment surface.
8                          The maximum reported lifespan (years) of the adult stage of the taxon.
9                   Larvae feed on plankton and spend a relatively long time in the water column.
10            Larvae feed on yolk reserves and spend a relatively short time in the water column.
11 Adults do not inhabit a restrictive structure. Able to move freely within and/or on sediments.
12                      External tissue is soft and not covered by any form of protective casing.
13        Adults capable of some (typically limited) movement along the sediment or rock surface.
14                                  Adults capable of active movement within the sediment matrix.
15                                                       Adults live on or just above the seabed.
16                                   Adults live below sediment surface between 0 and 5 cm depth.
17                                                                                           <NA>
