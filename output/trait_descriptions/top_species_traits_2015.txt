2                                                                                              <NA>
3                                                       Deposition of particles at sediment surface
4                                            Fertilised eggs are maintained by adult for protection
5                             Feeds on detritus (including algal material) on the sediment surface.
6                            The maximum reported lifespan (years) of the adult stage of the taxon.
7                     Larvae feed on plankton and spend a relatively long time in the water column.
8                                                                             Adults live in a tube
9                                                            Adults live on or in another organism.
10                        External tissue is soft and not covered by any form of protective casing.
11 Adults have little or no mobility. Typically attached or lives in (semi-) permanent burrow/tube.
12                                     Adults live below sediment surface between 0 and 5 cm depth.
13                                    Adults live below sediment surface between 5 and 10 cm depth.
14                                                                                             <NA>
15                   The maximum size (mm) that the taxon is known to reach during the adult stage.
