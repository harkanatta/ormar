An experimental study on recolonization and succession of marine macrobenthos in defaunated sediment
Received: 24 May 1999 /Accepted: 20 October 1999
Abstract Hypoxia/anoxia in coastal waters is a world wide problem which often results in mass mortality and defaunation of benthos. In this study, ®eld experiments were carried out to examine recolonization and succes-sion of macrobenthic infauna in defaunated sediments, and the time required for recovery from complete de-faunation to a stable community. Trays (33 cm length ´ 25.5 cm width ´ 11 cm depth) of defaunated sediment were exposed at the subtidal of a pristine site in subtropical Hong Kong. Temporal changes of macro-benthic communities in defaunated sediment were ana-lyzed by univariate and multivariate statistics, and compared with those in undisturbed natural sediment at the same site. Initial colonization of macrobenthos oc-curred rapidly. A total of 42 species was found, with an average of 258 animals per tray and 24 species per tray recorded in the ®rst month. Abundance showed a small peak (496 animals per tray) after 3 months, reached a sharp peak (1154 animals per tray) after 6 months, and declined thereafter. Species number increased gradually, reached a maximum (68 species per tray) after 9 months, and then decreased. Recolonization was predominantly contributed by larval settlement rather than adult mi-gration. Temporal changes in abundance, species num-ber and diversity of the macrobenthic community in defaunated sediment resemble the spatial changes along a decreasing pollution gradient previously de®ned by other authors. Results of this experiment suggest that newly available sediment may allow more species to colonize (or coexist) than sediment pre-occupied by an established community. This is probably due to less interspeci®c competition in the former habitat. No sig-ni®cant dierence in abundance or species richness was
observed between defaunated and natural sediments after 15 months, suggesting that a stable community had been achieved, although minor variations in species composition were still discernible between defaunated and natural sediments.
Introduction
Natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances, such as physical disturbance, oxygen depletion due to natural and anthropogenic causes and toxic chemicals, may cause defaunation of marine sediment over large areas (Rosenberg 1973, 1976, 1977; Grassle and Grassle 1974; Pearson and Rosenberg 1978; Santos and Simon 1980a, b; Arntz and Rumohr 1982, Wu 1982, Smith 1985, Diaz-Castaneda and Safran 1988; Berge 1990; Diaz-Casta-neda et al. 1993; Kenny and Rees 1994; Diaz and Rosenberg 1995). Mass mortalities of benthos due to hypoxia and anoxia, for example, have been reported commonly from many places all over the world (GES-AMP 1990; Diaz and Rosenberg 1995). Benthic recolo-nization may occur once the conditions that cause the defaunation abate or disappear.
Initial colonizers after defaunation caused by physi-cal disturbances are normally species with r-selected life history traits. These species may be well adapted to the new niches made available after the disturbance, and able to utilize the newly available resources quicker than their competitors (Grassle and Grassle 1974; Gray 1974; Pearson and Rosenberg 1978; Thistle 1981). The domi-nance of these opportunistic species at the initial suc-cessional stage is usually followed by severe mortality and, thereafter, they may be replaced by other species (Grassle and Grassle 1974; Rosenberg 1976; McCall 1977; Pearson and Rosenberg 1978; Santos and Simon 1980a, b; Arntz and Rumohr 1982; Berge 1990). It has been suggested that the sharp decline of opportunistic populations after the initial colonization is neither sea-sonal nor predator-induced, but is a result of biological interactions, e.g. inter- and intraspeci®c competition for

space and food, and/or accumulation of toxic substances (Grassle and Grassle 1974; Connell 1975; Connell and Slatyer 1977; McCall 1977; Whitlatch and Zajac 1985). In marine soft-bottom habitats, opportunistic macro-benthic species mainly consist of small polychaetes, particularly capitellid and spionid species such as Ca-pitella capitata and Polydora ligni (Grassle and Grassle 1974; Pearson and Rosenbeg 1978). The larvae of op-portunistic species normally have little or no selectivity in their substratum requirements (Pearson and Rosen-berg 1978). These opportunistic species act as pioneers and prepare the condition of the substrate for coloni-zation of other species, which have more elaborate set-tlement needs (Pearson and Rosenberg 1978; Arntz and Rumohr 1982). However, Zajac and Whitlatch (1982a, b) argued that the hypothesis correlating species' re-sponses to disturbance with life history adaptations might not be generally applicable to estuarine soft-bot-tom communities.
Pearson and Rosenberg (1978) summarized the spatial changes of soft-bottommacrobenthic communities along a decreasing gradient of organic pollution into the fol-lowing zones: (1) an azoic zone; (2) a community char-acterized by a sharp peak in the abundance of a few opportunistic species, but with low biomass; (3) an eco-tone point characterized by low biomass, low abundance and high diversity; (4) a transitory community with a maximum in species number and biomass; and (5) a stable community in terms of abundance, biomass and species number. They further suggested that temporal changes in abundance, species number and biomass in response to reduced pollution input resemble those occurring along a pollution gradient in space. The study of Arntz and Rumohr (1982) oered further support to Pearson and Rosenberg's pattern, but demonstrated strong seasonal oscillations in abundance, species number, biomass and diversity, with high values in summer and low values in winter.Diaz-Castaneda et al. (1993) reported that benthic recovery and succession in defaunated sediment of the North Sea after heavy metal pollution were characterized by a progressive increase in species number, abundance and biomass after a lag period.
Although a large number of ®eld surveys have been conducted describing spatial and temporal changes in natural benthic communities, very few detailed studies have been carried out to determine the patterns of recolonization and succession of macrobenthic com-munities after defaunation, especially in tropical and subtropical environments. The recovery times of macrobenthic communities are also poorly understood (Rosenberg 1976; Arntz and Rumohr 1982), albeit such information is not only of great ecological inter-est, but also of considerable practical use in environ-mental impact assessment and coastal management. The objective of the present study is to investigate the recolonization and succession of macrobenthic infauna in defaunated sediments, and the time required for recovery from complete defaunation to a stable com-munity.
Materials and methods
Field experiments were carried out for 15 months from April 1996 to July 1997 at Kat O (22°30¢N; 114°20¢E), a relatively pristine site in the northeast of Hong Kong. The site is sheltered and the sea bottom is homogeneous in terms of sediment particle size (see Fig. 1) and organic content. Water depth ranged from )0.5 to )1 m chart datum (CD). Sediment used in the experiments was collected from )0.5 m CD at the experimental site, and defaunated by air drying under natural sunlight for 1 month. Defaunated sediment was sampled and checked under a binocular dissecting microscope before use, to ensure that there were no living animals. Defaunated sediment was put in 90 labelled plastic trays (33 cm length ´ 25.5 cm width ´ 11 cm depth, surface area: 0.084 m2), and placed randomly at )0.5 m CD at the experimental site in April 1996. One month after deployment (i.e. May 1996), and monthly following this until July 1997, ®ve trays were retrieved. Earlier benthic studies indicated that ®ve replicate grabs/trays would sample over 90% of benthic species (Wu and Shin personal communication). Analysis of grab data from the present study site also con®rmed that cumulative number of species tended to level o when number of replicates increased to ®ve. During the study period (May 1996 to July 1997), ®ve replicate sediment samples were taken monthly from )0.5 m CD, using a 0.0375 m2 van Veen grab, from the natural sea bottom at the study site for comparison.
Sediment in each tray was washed through a 0.5 mm sieve, and the residues retained were preserved in a 10% formalin seawater solution. In the laboratory, benthic animals were sorted under a binocular dissecting microscope, identi®ed to the lowest possible taxonomic levels and counted. Sediment particle size was determined by the dry sieve method, and organic content by incinerating a dried sediment sample at 550 °C for 6 h (Buchanan 1984). Mean values of temperature, salinity anddissolved oxygen of the bottomwater at the experimental site were obtained from the routine monitoring pro-gram conducted by the Agriculture and Fisheries Department, the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
Dominant species in each sampling were identi®ed by rank-score analysis (Fager 1957). The ten most abundant species were ranked, with the most abundant species receiving the highest nu-merical rank. Biological index (BI) for each species was calculated by adding the values of each replicate for each sampling. The rarefaction method was used to reduce sampling bias resulting from dierent sampling area between grab and tray samples (Sanders 1968; Holme and McIntyre 1984).
Species diversity of each sample was calculated using Shannon± Wiener's index (H¢) (Shannon and Weaver 1963):
H 0  XS
i1
Ni N
log2 Ni N
  ;
where S = the number of species in the sample, N = the total number of individuals and Ni = the number of individuals in the ith species (i = 1 to S).

Species richness was calculated using Margalef 's index (d) (Margalef 1963):
d  S ÿ 1
log2 N ;
where S = species number and N = total number of individuals. Similarity between benthic samples was calculated using the
Bray±Curtis coecient (Bray and Curtis 1957):
Sjk  100 1ÿ Pp
i1 yij ÿ yik  Pp
i1 yij  yik ÿ  !
;
where Sjk = similarity between jth and kth samples and yij = the number of individuals for ith species in jth sample (i = 1, 2, . . . , p; j = 1, 2, . . . , n). The coecient ranges between 0 and 100%. S = 100 means that species compositions in the two samples were identical, while S = 0 means no common species in the two sam-ples. Data were transformed using a fourth equation root before computing the coecient.
Analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was carried out to test the null hypothesis that there were no dierences in community com-position between sample groups. ANOSIM was measured using the global test (R) (Clarke and Warwick 1994):
R  rB ÿ rW=M=2 ; where rB = the average of rank similarities from all pairs of rep-licates between dierent groups, rW = the average of all rank similarities among replicates within groups, M = n(n ) 1)/2 and n = the total number of samples under consideration. R varies between 0 and 1, indicating some degree of discrimination between groups. R = 1 means all replicates within groups are more similar to each other than any replicates from dierent groups; R is ap-proximately zero if similarities between and within groups are on average the same.
A two-tailed t-test was used to test dierences in benthic parameters between defaunated and natural sediments. A Dunnett's test was used to test signi®cant temporal changes in benthic parameters within the same type of sediment.
Results
Temperature at the study site ranged between 16.9 °C in February 1997 and 29.3 °C in July 1996, salinity be-tween 21.4& in July 1997 and 35.0& in January 1997, and dissolved oxygen between 6.4 mg l)1 in October 1996 and 8.8 mg l)1 in May 1997. Sediments at the site consisted mainly of coarse to medium sand (Fig. 1), with an organic content of 1.4%.
Initial recolonization
Initial recolonization occurred rapidly within the ®rst month after deployment of the sediment trays, i.e. May 1996. A total of 42 species, with an average of 258 ani-mals per tray and 24 species per tray, were recorded. Initial colonizers were dominated by polychaetes (24 species, accounting for 57% of total species). In terms of numerical abundance, polychaetes (27%) and gastro-pods (23%) dominated the recolonized community.
Abundance and species number
Abundance increased after the ®rst month, exhibited a small peak (496 animals per tray) after 3 months, in-
creased to a sharp peak (1154 animals per tray) after 6 months, and declined thereafter. Species number in-creased steadily, reached a maximum (68 species per tray) after 9 months and decreased afterwards (Fig. 2). Abundance and species number tended to stabilize and then oscillate within a narrow range during the later stages of the experiment. This suggests that an equilib-rium community has been established after about 1 year.
Species diversity
H¢ reached a ®rst peak (4.7) after 4 months and a second peak (4.8) after 8 months (Fig. 3). The decrease in H¢ observed in October 1996 was due to the strong domi-nance of the bivalve Spondervilia sp.
Species composition
A total of 196 species, including 82 species of poly-chaetes, 39 species of bivalves, 35 species of gastropods, 7 species of decapods, 6 species of nemerteans, 5 species of amphipods, 4 species of turbellarians, 2 species each of actinians, sipunculians, isopods and echinoids, 1 species each of scaphopod, ostracod, cumacean, insect, phoronid, ophiuroid, branchiopod, amphioxus and ®sh were recorded from the defaunated sediment during the study. The top ®ve dominant species in defaunated and natural sediments in each month, as identi®ed by the BI, are shown in Table 1. The top ®ve species accounted for between 39% and 78% of total abundance in the sam-ples. Dominant species changed during the study period, and changes were especially marked during the ®rst few months. The top ®ve dominant species and the most abundant species in the defaunated sediment were the same during the period March to May 1997, i.e. 12 to 14 months post-establishment. A comparison of temporal changes of the 14 dominant species between the defau-nated and natural sediments over the experimental pe-riod is shown in Fig. 4. Dierent species peaked during dierent months indicating a succession of benthic spe-cies. The bivalve Spondervilia sp. reached a sharp peak 6

months after the start of the experiment but declined drastically thereafter (Fig. 4).
The polychaetes Chloeia parva and Leonnates persica, the gastropod Cerithidea cingulata and the ®sh Gobiodon sp. were only found in the ®rst month. These species were present as adults while most of the other benthic species found in the defaunated sediment were juveniles, indicating that recolonization was predominantly by larval settlement rather than adult migration.
Comparison with the natural community
Abundance in defaunated sediment was not signi®cantly dierent to that of the natural sediment during the ®rst 3 months and also after January 1997. Abundance was signi®cantly higher in defaunated sediment from Octo-ber 1996 to January 1997 (Fig. 5), and this was mainly attributed to colonization by opportunistic species. Since species richness (d ) and diversity (H¢) are dependent on sampling area, values of H¢ and d in natural sediment were normalized for the same area as the sediment trays before comparisons were made, using the relationship between these two parameters and sampling area derived from natural sediment. Species richness (d ) in defaun-ated sediment was signi®cantly higher than that in nat-ural sediment from November 1996 to January 1997, but signi®cantly lower in the ®rst month and in June 1997 (Fig. 6). H¢ in the defaunated community was signi®-cantly lower in the ®rst, the third and the last months, but signi®cantly higher in the second month (Fig. 3).
A total of 149 species were recorded from the natural sediment throughout the study period, of which 140, i.e. 94%, were also found in the defaunated sediment. Only nine species (6%) were found in natural sediment but not in the defaunated sediment. On the other hand, 56 species (28.6%) were found in defaunated sediment but not in the natural sediment. Only seven species, i.e. Caulleriella bioculata, Galathowenia sp., Pionosyllis sp., Prionospio malmgreni, Pseudomalacoceros cantabra, Sphaerosyllis hystrix and Pulsellum sp., occurred com-monly in both the defaunated and natural sediments every month throughout the study period.
All dominant species in defaunated sediment were found in natural sediment. Some species, e.g.
Chironomidae sp., Gastropoda sp. 1, Caulleriella bio-culata, Spondervilia sp. and Amphipoda sp.1, were abundant in defaunated sediment but much rarer in the natural community. It is noteworthy that temporal variations of other dominant species, e.g. Musculus mirandus, Prionospio malmgreni, Aonides oxycephala, Epicodakia delicatula and Capitella capitata, exhibited a similar pattern in both defaunated and natural sedi-ments (Fig. 4).
Although the top ®ve dominant species of defaunated and natural communities in the ®rst few months during the study were quite dierent, most of the dominant species became similar after February 1997 (Table 1), suggesting an increase in similarity between the two communities in the later phases of the study period. Temporal changes in similarity between defaunated and natural sediments during the study period are presented in Fig. 7. Similarity between the two communities was 32% after 1 month. This increased to 60% after 4 months, and ¯uctuated between 47% and 60% there-after. Results of a one-way ANOSIM for the two sample groups are presented in Fig. 8. Global R oscillated but showed a clear decreasing trend (slope <0) during the study period, indicating an increase in similarity between the defaunated and natural communities over time. The signi®cance level of this test was, however, less than 0.01 for each month over the study period, suggesting that signi®cant dierences in species composition still existed between the defaunated and natural communities after 15 months.
Discussion
Temporal changes in the abundance and species diver-sity of macrobenthos in defaunated sediments investi-gated in the present study resembled closely the spatial successional pattern of macrobenthic infauna along a gradient of organic pollution in temperate regions (Pearson and Rosenberg 1978). The following stages of macrobenthic succession were observed in this study: (1) a pre-opportunistic period with a small peak of abun-dance and increasing numbers of species, associated with a peak in H¢; (2) a sharp peak in abundance with a relatively high number of species and high H¢; (3) an

ecotone point with a second peak of H¢ and low abun-dance; (4) a transition zone with a maximum species number and decreasing H¢; and (5) a stable community with low abundance and species numbers and seasonal oscillation. Arntz and Rumohr (1982) found a similar pattern in their study.
Initial colonizers in temperate regions are usually polychaetes, especially capitellids and spionids, which are considered to be ``opportunistic'' species (Rosenberg 1973; Grassle and Grassle 1974; McCall 1977; Pearson and Rosenberg 1978; Arntz and Rumohr 1982; Zajac and Whitlatch 1982a, b; Whitlatch and Zajac 1985; Tsutsumi 1987; Diaz-Castaneda et al. 1989, 1993; Berge 1990; Ruth et al. 1994). Opportunistic species have r-strategy life histories (McCall 1977) that are charac-terized by quick initial response to disturbed conditions, an ability to increase rapidly to large population sizes with early maturity and followed by high mortality (Grassle and Grassle 1974). The spionid polychaete Prionospio malmgreni was determined to be the oppor-tunistic species recolonizing defaunated, organic-en-riched sediment in Hong Kong (Lu and Wu 1998). In the present study, Chironomidae sp. and Gastropoda sp. 1 dominated initial colonization during the ®rst month. The large increase in abundance was typically followed by a high mortality of both species. Other species typi-
cally contributing to the abundance peak were the bi-valve Spondervilia sp., as well as the gastropods Gastropoda sp. 3 and Clypeomorus sp. Five species, i.e. Chironomidae sp., Gastropoda sp. 1, Caulleriella bio-culata, Spondervilia sp. and Gastropoda sp. 3, appeared to exhibit the characteristics of opportunistic colonizers. Despite being present, neither capitellids or spionids showed the typical opportunistic life histories charac-teristic of temperate environments. Abundance of the well-known cosmopolitan opportunist Capitella capitata in defaunated sediment showed a similar trend to that in natural sediment during the study period. The results of this study, therefore, indicate that responses to distur-bance by species known as cosmopolitan opportunists may not be generally applicable to the soft-bottom macrobenthic communities of subtropical regions. Fur-thermore, the results presented herein support the sug-gestion of Zajac and Whitlatch (1982a) that initial colonization and the designation of species as ``oppor-tunists'' may be highly dependent on species availability at the time when the substrate is made available.
Connell and Slatyer (1977) postulated three con-trasting models in benthic succession: facilitation, tol-erance and inhibition, all of which are characterized by interspeci®c interactions. Zajac and Whitlatch (1982b) have shown that succession in marine macrobenthic

infauna may be best described by tolerance and inhibi-tion models. In a later study, however, these authors provided evidence of interspeci®c facilitation during an initial period when overall benthic densities were low (Whitlatch and Zajac 1985). In the present study, re-placement of early dominant species was commonly observed during successional stages. This pattern ap-pears to ®t well into the facilitation model, in which early colonizers modify the substratum, making it less favorable for their own survival but more favorable for the establishment of their successors.
Most (94%) species recorded in natural sediment were able to colonize the defaunated sediment at some time during the 15 month study period. This suggests that: (1) benthic succession in defaunated sediment was more or less complete within 15 months and (2) recol-onizing depended in an important way on the natural stock of colonizers prevailing in the area. Of the species recorded, 28% in the present study were, however, only recorded in defaunated and not in natural sediment. It appears, therefore, that newly available (defaunated) sediment may allow more species to colonize, or co-exist, than natural sediment which is presumably occupied by a stable benthic community. Less intense interspeci®c competition may allow more species to colonize the newly available habitat of defaunated sediment. Except for a few species, e.g. the polychaetes Chloeia parva and Leonnates persica, the gastropod Cerithidea cingulata and the ®sh Gobiodon sp., which were present as adults, most other benthic species colonizing the defaunated sediment were juveniles. The results, therefore, suggest that recolonization took place predominantly by settle-ment of meroplanktonic larvae rather than adult mi-gration: the same conclusion was also drawn in the study by Santos and Simon (1980a).
Studies in temperate regions have shown that benthic recovery is a slow process and may take several years (Boesch and Rosenberg 1981), especially in deeper waters (>50 m) where benthic species are adapted to a relatively stable physical environment. Macrobenthic communities in Gullmar Fjord, Sweden (water depth: 115 m), for example, had not re-established 18 months after a major hypoxic event (Josefson and Widbom 1988). Little to no recovery was found in the Kattegat, Sweden (water depth: 5 to 53 m), 2 years after a benthic defaunation caused by hypoxia (Rosenberg et al. 1992). Likewise, only 36% of initial benthic biomass was re-corded 3 years after an incidence of hypoxia-induced benthic defaunation in the northern Adriatic Sea (Sta-chowitsch 1991). Furthermore, many previously domi-nant species failed to return within 1 year after hypoxia on the New Jersey inner continental shelf (Boesch and Rosenberg 1981). Boesch and Rosenberg (1981) sug-gested that several years are required for recovery of benthic communities. In the present study, however, recolonization of the defaunated sediment occurred at a relatively rapid rate. Benthic composition became 60% similar to that of the natural community within 5 months, and 94% of species occurring in the naturalF

community were found in the defaunated sediment within 15 months. In the defaunated sediment, measures of community structure (e.g. abundance, number of species and diversity) showed no signi®cant dierences to those of the natural sediment after 4 to 10 months. The results in this study show that a stable, established community was reached less than 15 months after de-faunation. Some minor dierences in species composi-tion were, however, still discernible between defaunated and natural sediments. Boesch and Rosenberg (1981) postulated that the resilience of a benthic community, after hypoxia, depends on the constituent species, life cycles and reproductive patterns. The rapid recovery of the marine macrobenthic infauna in the present study agrees well with the results of a previous study in sub-
tropical Hong Kong (Wu 1982), as well as benthic re-colonization in South Florida, where latitude and water depth are similar (Santos and Simons 1980b). Compared with their temperate counterparts, infaunal communities in the tropics and subtropics are composed of more small opportunistic species with a more rapid growth rate, earlier reproduction and higher reproductive po-tential (Alongi 1989, 1990). The rapid recovery found in the present study as well as in other shallow subtropical areas such as South Florida (Santos and Simons 1980b) may be attributed to the dierences in community composition and life history traits of species between temperate and subtropical benthos.
