Abstract
The process of recovery of the macrozoobenthos community on tidal flats after disturbance by anoxia was studied by monitoring changes in the macrozoobenthos over periods of up to 4.5 year within and around eleven defaunated squares of about 120 m2 each. Regardless of the season, nearly all species that were present in the surrounding area had settled again in the central parts of the plots within 6 months, though their numbers were generally low if only a winter half-year had elapsed. The total numbers of macrobenthic animals reached values similar to those of the surrounding areas as soon as the recovery period had included at least one summer. Numerical recovery thus proceeded much faster if it started in spring than in autumn. As opposed to species richness and total number of animals, biomass recovery needed several years, as did the recovery of the size and age structure of the long-lived species. Most species settled primarily as early postlarvae in summer, a few species (Macoma balthica, Arenicola marina) also in high numbers as juveniles in winter. Moreover, several species showed slow colonisation in all seasons by adults transported by tidal currents or moving across the sediment. Seasonal migration abilities of the constituent species and their life stages appear to be the most important mechanism explaining the course of the recovery of the infaunal community on tidal flats. The extraordinarily successful settlement of larvae of several species within still sparsely populated plots led to (sometimes substantially) higher densities of these species within than outside the plots. Such abundance overshoots were not only frequently observed in short-lived opportunistic species (such as Pygospio elegans and Capitella capitata) but also in the juveniles of several long-lived species (such as Macoma balthica and Mya arenaria). It is concluded that inhibition outside rather than facilitation within the plots was an important cause of these abundance overshoots.  1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

1992; Beukema, 1995), lack of oxygen (Rosenberg et al., 1992; Diaz and Rosenberg, 1995), red tides (Simon and Dauer, 1977), strong waves or currents (Hall, 1994), etc. Owing to the wide variety of causes, scales of space and time of natural and man-made disturbances vary widely (Hall et al., 1994; Zajac et al., 1998). Disturbing incidences tend to occur frequently particularly in coastal seas, on tidal flats and in estuaries. On Wadden Sea tidal flats, large-scale mass mortality of zoobenthos has oc-curred as a consequence of such diverse disturbing events as dredging (Van der Veer et al., 1985), burial of carpets of green macro-algae (Neira and Racke-mann, 1996), and accumulation plus sedimentation of phytoplankton blooms (Mastenbroek, 1964; Höp-ner and Michaelis, 1994; Cadée, 1996; Delafontaine and Flemming, 1997). The subsequent decompo-sition of such accumulations causes local oxygen depletion, visible as black spots at the sediment sur-face. In the German Wadden Sea, the areas covered by green macro-algae (Reise et al., 1994) and black spots (Höpner and Michaelis, 1994) have increased considerably over the last decade. Such black areas, devoid of animal life, can cover several km2. There is thus an increasing need for knowledge on pro-cesses that lead to the recovery of such defaunated areas. Macrobenthic animals play essential roles in the functioning of marine ecosystems, particularly in shallow coastal areas. Even partial removal of the benthos over large areas has far-reaching con-sequences (Beukema and Cadée, 1996; Beukema et al., 1998). Therefore, it is important to know how fast benthic communities can recover and by which mechanisms such recovery proceeds.
So far, recovery studies have been either de-scriptive or experimental. Studies of the first type are often of a large-scale nature but mostly lack essential information (e.g. on the completeness of the defaunation) and=or adequate comparisons with undisturbed situations. Studies of the experimental type have mostly been executed on too small a scale of <1 m2 (Hall et al., 1994), though there is a no-table exception of defaunated 20-m2 plots (Dittmann et al., 1999). In practice, disturbances are often on a scale so large that it cannot properly be mimicked in experiments. Moreover, to follow the recovery of large areas to completeness will take more time (sev-eral years) than the duration of the usual experiments
(<1 year). Therefore, we decided to study faunal recovery at defaunated plots as large as we could manage over several years in succession. Moreover, we have tried to find out which processes and mech-anisms play an important role in the re-population process to allow better extrapolations to larger areas.
We report on the recovery of a tidal-flat commu-nity in terms of species number, numerical abundance and biomass as it took place in eleven defaunated plots of 120 m2 each located in the western part of the Wadden Sea. Over several years we compared the development of the macrozoobenthic communi-ties within these plots with those in the immediately surrounding areas. In addition, the occurrence of ben-thic animals in the water of a nearby tidal stream was recorded. In these ways, we try to answer two main questions: (1) how long does it take macrozoobenthic tidal-flat communities to recover in terms of species richness, numerical abundance and biomass, and (2) which mechanisms and between-species interactions play a role during the recovery process.
2. Methods
The experiments were carried out on Balgzand, a tidal-flat area in the westernmost part of the Wadden Sea. Squares of about 120 m2 were made azoic by placing a thick mat of synthetic material over 12ð12 m of the sediment and digging in its borders. After about three months, the mat was removed. This procedure was repeated eleven times, with removal dates in April of 1983, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1990 and in late autumn or early winter of 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1989. The defaunated plots were marked by iron poles. The length of the periods of observation of individual plots ranged from 0.5 to 4.5 years (for several reasons it was not the same in all plots, e.g. because poles were lost).
All eleven plots were located on tidal flats in the southwestern half of Balgzand, nine of them on the same flat, viz. around point B in fig. 2 of Beukema (1988, 1993). All plots were located at distances of about 100 to 400 m from a tidal stream and were sur-rounded by extensive areas of similar and homoge-neously looking sand flats. Tidal currents were rather weak above the plots and the sediment was stable and fine (medium grain size 150–170 µm, silt con-

tent 2–4%). The intertidal height of the plots was generally between mean-tide level (MTL) and 0.5 m below MTL (at Balgzand, low-tide level is 0.8 m be-low MTL). Details on Balgzand and its macrobenthic fauna can be found in Beukema (1988).
The defaunation of soft-sediment plots by ap-plying a cover for a few months appears to be a proper method, killing the fauna (almost) completely (Thrush et al., 1996; compare Section 3.1.1) and apparently hardly affecting the suitability of the sed-iment for colonising organisms after the removal of the cover. Though the sediment is initially black af-ter such a treatment, a normal oxidation gradient is restored rapidly (within a few tides) and the usual di-atom mat recovers within a few days (as described by Dittmann et al. (1999), who did similar experiments on a tidal flat in the German Wadden Sea).
The macrofauna within and around most plots was usually sampled once or twice annually, viz. in spring (nearly always in April) and=or in autumn (generally in September or October). On all sam-pling occasions, core samples to a depth of about 30 cm were taken on the same day in the central part of the plots (at least 1 or 2 m from the borders) as well as outside the plots (at about 5 m around their edges). Both inside and outside the plots, four large samples of 0.1 m2 each plus ten small samples of 0.01 m2 each were taken and immediately sieved in the field (1-mm square meshes for the large samples and 0.5-mm meshes for the small samples). The ani-mals retained by the sieves were counted alive in the laboratory (species of small worms were included only if a high proportion of the adults was retained on the 0.5-mm sieve, thus excluding the oligochaetes and the smallest species of polychaetes). The num-bers of individuals counted of each species in each of the fourteen samples were expressed per 0.5 m2
in one of the following two ways: (a) in all large animals (that could not be overlooked in any sample) the numbers found in all samples (4ð0:1C10ð0:01 m2 D 0.5 m2) were added, or (b) in smaller animals the numbers found in the small samples (10 ð 0:01 m2 D 0.1 m2) were multiplied by five. To obtain biomass values, ash-free dry weights (AFDW) were determined for each species on each sampling oc-casion and separately for the samples taken inside and outside the plots in the following way: drying at 60ºC for several days in a well-ventilated stove,
weighing, incineration at about 550ºC for two hours and weighing of the ash. Whenever possible, the in-dividuals of a species were divided into size and age groups.
Data are shown both for all species together (species number, total numerical abundance, and biomass) and for separate species. We express the degree of recovery of the fauna of a disturbed plot in a ratio value, viz. the amount found in the sam-ples taken within the plot divided by the comparable amount found in the samples taken in the immedi-ate surroundings of the plot. For statistical tests of significance of differences between mean numerical densities inside and outside individual plots we used the Wilcoxon test with n D 10C 10 (10ð 0:01 m2). At p < 0:05, we designed the ratio value to be sig-nificantly different from 1.0 (bold and italic figures in Table 1).
It should be noted that the different plots can-not be considered genuine replicates. For logistic reasons, we could not create more than two defau-nated plots per year. Thus plots differed not only in geographic position (in nearly all cases not more than a few hundred metres), but also in season (ei-ther early spring or late autumn=early winter, but no fixed dates) and year (between 1983 and 1990) of the start of the recovery period. The generally large year-to-year differences in recruitment success in the various species living on the tidal flats of the Wad-den Sea (Beukema, 1982) were probably the cause of substantial differences in numerical abundance between plots with nearly identical recovery peri-ods. For this reason, we did not try to evaluate the statistical significance of multi-plot averages. Such averages were used only to show rough trends with time of completeness of recovery (population inside as proportion of population outside plot).
In seven plots, additional samples were taken with a small corer (diameter 4 or 6 cm) during the first summer after the removal of the mat, viz. fortnightly to monthly during the May–September period. These samples were sieved after formalin fixation, resulting in elevated numbers of small-sized worms retained by the sieves (as compared to live sieving).
Fishing for macrobenthic animals in an adjacent tidal stream (draining the tidal flats where nearly all plots were situated) was performed by suspending a net with an opening of 1 m2 and 1 mm mesh width

3.1.1. Observations at the start of the recovery period
Immediately after removal of the mat, dead ani-mals (mostly as empty shell doublets) were observed in large numbers on top of the black sediment. Nearly all macrozoobenthic species (usually about
15 such species had been present) had died out completely. If a few animals were found alive, they belonged to the polychaete species Heteromastus fil-iformis (Clap.) and Nereis diversicolor O.F.M. The remaining numerical densities of these two persistent species were nearly always 1% or less of those found in the surrounding areas. Only once, did we find about 10% of H. filiformis still alive and, therefore, executed a full sampling on that one occasion. The resulting points (at 0-time) in Fig. 1 are certainly maximal values of all eleven plots.

Separate values for all abundant species (i.e. if total number found in outside samples >1) and in some species specified per age class. Av. D weighted means for the n plots sampled after the same recovery period (1W D one winter, 1S D one summer, etc.). All numbers shown are rounded to one (one-plot data) or two (averages) digits. For example, 0.1 means a number between 0.05 and 0.15, 1.0 a number between 0.95 and 1.05, and 1 a number between 0.95 and 1.5. 0 means that there were no specimens at all in the samples taken within the plots. Statistically significant differences between inside and outside densities are indicated either in bold figures (ratio <1.0, i.e. incomplete recovery) or in italics (ratio >1, i.e. overshoot).
surrounding area were also represented in the sam-ples taken within the experimental plots. About 20% were still lacking if the initial recovery period had been a winter half-year (right-hand graph of Fig. 1A: the point at W). A recovery period including a sum-mer half-year and also recovery periods lasting at least one full year resulted in species numbers within the plots that were close to those found in the ar-eas surrounding the plots (Fig. 1A: the subsequent points).
Total numbers of macrozoobenthic animals within the plots were always significantly below those of the surrounding area if only a winter had elapsed (right-hand graph of Fig. 1B: the points at W with ratio values around 0.2), but these numbers became similar and often even significantly higher if there had been at least one summer between mat removal and sampling (Fig. 1B: the subsequent points). Af-ter one summer, there were still two (out of five) plots with significantly incomplete recovery of total

The course of the recovery process during 4-year periods, shown separately for (A) species richness, (B) total numbers of macrozoobenthic animals, and (C) total macrozoobenthic biomass (AFDW). Time on the horizontal axis is expressed in the number of summers (S) and winters (W) elapsed between mat removal and observation. At each sampling time, one point denotes an observation at one individual plot and the line indicates the averages of the plots. The additional open points and broken line in (B) show values after exclusion of the data on sometimes very numerous small gastropods (Hydrobia ulvae) and crustaceans (Corophium sp.). The graphs of the left-hand column show absolute values either per 0.5 (A) or 1 m2 (B, C); those of the right-hand column show ratio values, i.e. value observed within the plot divided by the comparable value in the surroundings of the plot. Note the log scale of the left-hand graph of (B). In the right-hand graph of (B), the larger points denote ratio values that differed statistically significantly from the 1.0 value (p < 0:05, Wilcoxon test with n D 10C 10).

numbers, but also one plot where the total numbers of individuals was significantly higher within than outside the plot. Ratio values significantly >1 were also observed in some plots after longer recovery periods (see the large points in the right-hand graph of Fig. 1B). Such abundance overshoots originated in particular from extra-high numbers of juveniles of a variety of species within the plots (see Section 3.5).
Though plot-to-plot differences in total numbers of animals were generally large (amounting to an order of magnitude variation after similar recovery periods), ratio values varied much less (mostly no more than twofold after similar recovery periods). Note that the inclusion of the mostly very high numbers of the small-sized species Hydrobia and Corophium could cause a tenfold rise of total nu-merical densities (left-hand graph of Fig. 1B), but in such cases hardly affected the ratio values (right-hand graph of Fig. 1B: the solid and broken lines are almost identical).
Biomass lagged far behind with only about 5% recovery after a winter half-year (right-hand graph of Fig. 1C: the points at W) and about 40% recovery after a summer half-year or a full year (Fig. 1C: the three series of points at S, W C S, and S CW). Even after two summers, biomass was still significantly lower (by about 20 to 40%) within than outside the plots (Fig. 1C: the points at 2S). Only after three or more summers had the inside=outside biomass ratios become close to a value of 1.0, indicating complete recovery (Fig. 1C: the series of points at 3S and 4S).
Note in the right-hand parts of Fig. 1B (numbers) and Fig. 1C (biomass) that similar recovery values were observed after one summer half-year and a summer half-year plus a winter half-year (the similar values in Fig. 1B and Fig. 1C at S, W C S, and S C W). Thus there was no additional effect on total numbers or biomass of an extra winter preceding or following a summer (as there was also only a low recovery of numbers and biomass after a single winter: the low points at W in Fig. 1B and Fig. 1C). The similarity between the values at W C S and S C W indicates that the order of the seasons did not matter for the recovery result after a full year. This means that the differences in timing of the start of the recovery period (either in spring or in autumn) no longer differentially affected the results after a full year had elapsed.
To summarise, recovery of both species richness and total numbers was (nearly) accomplished within six to twelve months (at least one summer should be included), whereas complete recovery of total biomass required a longer period, including at least three summers.
3.2. The development of recovery by species
About fifteen macrobenthic species were present in sufficiently high densities (>2 per m2) in the areas surrounding the experimental plots to warrant a study of their immigration into the plots. They did not return equally fast (Table 1). Early recovery rates will be dealt with separately for two situations, depending on whether the first half-year period was a winter or a summer. Later recovery (after two or more summers) will be reported in less detail.
In the following, species will be denoted by their genus name. The full names are included in Table 1, arranged in alphabetical order under the headings polychaetes, crustaceans, gastropods, and bivalves.
3.2.1. Recovery after a winter season only In the four plots that were sampled for the first
time in late winter or early spring after removal of the mat in late autumn (or early winter), most of the species that were abundant in the surrounding ar-eas had already returned, though mostly in relatively small numbers (Table 1 under 1W: in more than half of the species values >0 were found, but most of them were well <1). The degree of recovery differed widely between species and their age groups. Adult bivalves had not yet returned (0% of ambient den-sities). Similarly, low recovery rates were observed in adults of more or less large-sized worms: Areni-cola, Harmothoe (Antinoella), Nephtys, and Nereis. Among the smaller-sized worms (i.e. those with adults just thick enough to be completely retained by a 0.5-mm sieve and juveniles of large-sized species), recovery ranged from mostly <10% (Heteromastus, juveniles of Nephtys and Nereis) to around 25% (Eteone, Phyllodoce, and Scoloplos). High degrees of recovery (generally >50%) already after one win-ter were observed in the juveniles of two species: the tellinid bivalve Macoma and the lugworm Areni-cola. Juveniles of these two species were present in relatively high numbers in all plots. As opposed
242 J.J. Beukema et al. / Journal of Sea Research 42 (1999) 235–254
to the older stages of Arenicola and Macoma, the juveniles of these two species did not show statisti-cally significant differences in density between any of the plot areas and their surroundings. The animals showing rapid re-colonisation in winter belonged to the youngest age group of their species and could easily be distinguished from members of older age groups. Macoma juveniles lacked a clear year mark and had a shell length of generally <8 mm (and nearly always <10 mm), Arenicola juveniles were lightly coloured and had an AFDW of generally <50 mg (and nearly always <100 mg).
3.2.2. Recovery after one summer After only one summer half-year of recovery
(April to September or October), several species were already present in high densities, often equalling or even surpassing those found outside the plots (Ta-ble 1: the column under 1S). The added numbers of individuals of all species together were at that time already similar inside and outside the plots (right-hand graph of Fig. 1B: the points at S). In some species even substantially (and often statistically sig-nificantly) higher numbers were found within some of the plots, viz. in the total numbers of Heteromastus, Phyllodoce and Corophium, and also in the numbers of juveniles of Nereis and in the spat of most bivalves, viz. Cerastoderma, Macoma and Mya (Table 1: the italic figures under 1S). As such abundance over-shoots were also observed after longer recovery peri-ods, they will be dealt with under a separate heading (see Section 3.5). In most other species, significant overshoots were absent, but densities within the plots had often reached a level equalling (at least half of) the ambient densities: total numbers of Hydrobia and numbers of juveniles of Arenicola, Lanice, Nephtys, Carcinus, Crangon, and Ensis. In contrast, all large-sized and older age groups of the species with big adults were still almost restricted to the area around the plots (adults of the worms Arenicola, Harmo-thoe, Nephtys, and Nereis, and of the bivalves Ceras-toderma, Mya, and Macoma). This near-absence of large specimens explains the lower total-biomass val-ues within the plots as compared to the areas around the plots (Fig. 1C at S).
As compared to the samplings after one winter only (first column of Table 1), within-plot increases in a summer half-year period were much larger in
most of the small and medium-sized worms and in juveniles of large-sized worms, in the crustaceans, the gastropods, and the spat of bivalves. On the other hand, results of sampling after a winter and a summer half-year period were similar in their lack of recovery of adults of the larger worms and bivalves.
3.2.3. Some details of the recovery process in the first summer
The small samples taken frequently during the first summer half-year after removal of the mat sup-plied extra data on the detailed course of the devel-opment of the populations inside and outside seven plots. They also yielded additional information on the dynamics of two species that were not counted in samples obtained during the routine biannual sam-pling program, viz. Pygospio elegans and Capitella capitata. The abundance of these two species of small worms showed clear overshoots in most plots where they were observed (4 out of 7 plots in Pygos-pio and 4 out of 5 in Capitella).
Both inside and outside the plots, numerical den-sities of the various species generally increased dur-ing spring and early summer and declined again in late summer and autumn. Such changes will reflect a normal seasonal course of densities of benthic ani-mals on tidal flats: during spring and early summer, recruitment exceeds mortality and during autumn the reverse is true in nearly all species. However, the rates of change could differ inside and outside the plots. Inside the plots, densities started from very low values in April or May (a short time after mat removal) and generally rose more steeply than in the surroundings of the plots. As a result, maxi-mal densities of several species in (late) summer were higher inside than outside (some of the) plots. Such overshoots were observed particularly in small worms and in spat of bivalves. Usually, the rela-tive differences in maximal summer densities were still present in the autumn samples. The resulting (inside=outside) ratio values of >1 are shown in Ta-ble 1 (columns 1S and 1W C 1S). Rates of decline in autumn did not consistently differ inside and out-side the plots. However, in the two small-sized worm species Pygospio and Capitella the decline from the high summer densities tended to be steeper inside than outside the plots. Exactly these two species showed not only very high densities (thousands per
J.J. Beukema et al. / Journal of Sea Research 42 (1999) 235–254 243
m2) but also the highest proportions of overshoots (more than half of the plots where they occurred).
3.2.4. Recovery after a full year (summer C winter or winter C summer)
As the mats were removed either in early spring or in late autumn=early winter, a full year could comprise either a summer C a winter or a winter C a summer. The similarity of the data for S C W and W C S in both Fig. 1 and Table 1 indicates that the order of summer and winter within the first year of recovery did not really matter for the completeness of recovery after a full year. Therefore, these two cases will be dealt with together.
In most species, at least the juvenile stages had reached densities within the plots after one year that were similar to or even higher than those observed in the surrounding areas. Significant overshoots were frequent in the abundance of juveniles of Arenicola and the spat of Macoma and Mya. On the other hand, recovery was again still far from complete in adults of the larger-sized species such as Arenicola, Harmothoe, Nereis, Nephtys, Macoma, and Mya.
In most species, the values after a full year hardly differed from those after only one summer (compare the values at S with those at S C W or W C S in Fig. 1 and in Table 1). Substantially higher values after a full year than after a summer half-year were observed in the juveniles of Arenicola. As shown above, these animals were able to recover equally well in winter and in summer and thus had experienced two half-year periods of rapid recovery after S CW or W C S.
3.2.5. Recovery in later years Species or their juvenile age groups that had al-
ready reached the 100% recovery level after one summer or one year (showing a ratio close to 1.0 in the second, third or fourth columns of Table 1) again showed densities that were generally close to those of the surrounding areas during the subsequent years (e.g. total numbers of Eteone, Heteromastus, Scolo-plos, Lanice, and Hydrobia and juveniles of Nephtys and Nereis, Carcinus, Crangon and Cerastoderma). The initially frequent and substantial overshoots ob-served in many species gradually declined in most of these species and finally tended to disappear. As a consequence, the incidence of overshoots was

maximal after one or two summers, but declined af-ter longer recovery periods (broken line in Fig. 2). The occurrence of significantly incomplete recov-eries (‘underscores’ in Fig. 2: full line) showed a different pattern: it consistently declined with in-creasing length of the recovery period.
Among the groups that had not yet completely recovered after one summer, the adults of Nephtys and 1-group Cerastoderma started to show similar densities inside and outside the plots after the second summer. Adult stages of Arenicola, Nereis and Har-mothoe reached more or less complete recovery only after the third summer. Thus, after three or four sum-mers the abundance of nearly all species (and even of their adult stages in most of them) had reached the level observed in the surroundings of the plot. As a consequence, the proportion of ‘underscores’ in Fig. 2 approaches 0 after four summers of recovery.
244 J.J. Beukema et al. / Journal of Sea Research 42 (1999) 235–254
However, the oldest age groups of the long-lived (about 10 year) species Macoma and Mya had not yet reached similar densities inside and outside the plots after four summers.
3.3. An example of a recovering species
As a (typical) example of the contrasting dynam-ics of a species within and outside the plots, Fig. 3 shows the changes in the numbers of Macoma be-longing to a number of successive year classes inside as well as outside one single defaunated plot. This species was chosen because it occurs in high densi-ties and age groups can easily be distinguished by counting the number of year marks on their shells.
On the first sampling occasion in late winter, after a four-month recovery period that started in Novem-ber, only Macoma of spat size (0-group, born in the preceding spring) were present within the plot. They must have reached the empty plots as juveniles with a shell length of several mm (maximally about 10 mm). In the area surrounding the plot, 0-group

The course of numerical densities (numbers per 0.5 m2 on a log scale) of Macoma balthica belonging to various age groups as observed on successive sampling occasions (at the end of either a winter W or a summer S), (a) inside the plot that started recovery of its fauna about 4 months before the first sampling, and (b) in the area surrounding the plot. Solid points and full lines refer to adults (of several age classes together) that were already >1 year old on the first sampling occasion, whereas open points and broken lines refer to single year classes whose members were of spat size on the sampling occasion when they were first encountered (indicated by the location of first point of each broken line).
densities were similar, but there were also substan-tial numbers of older (1C) specimens (with a shell length ranging from about 10 to 25 mm and with at least one clear year mark). The numbers of 0-group animals that had arrived in the plot during winter gradually declined during the following years at a rather low rate of about 20% per year (Fig. 3a). In the surrounding area, the numbers of this age group appeared to decline initially at a higher rate (Fig. 3b). The explanation of this difference in dynamics inside and outside the plot may be that spat-sized Macoma were still migrating in early spring (see Beukema and De Vlas, 1989) after the late winter sampling and that higher proportions of these recently settled juveniles stayed inside than outside the plot. Only outside the plot was the number of Arenicola high, and the sediment reworking activities of these ani-mals are known to disturb juveniles of other species, including small Macoma (Flach, 1992a).
Members of older age groups were numerous in the surrounding area and these numbers declined gradually (Fig. 3b). Within the plot area (Fig. 3a), on
J.J. Beukema et al. / Journal of Sea Research 42 (1999) 235–254 245
the other hand, the numbers of such older animals (at least one year old at the start of the recovery period) gradually increased over the 3-year period of observation, but they remained much lower than in the area around the plot (roughly a ten-fold dif-ference; note the log scale of Fig. 3). They were observed particularly in the border zone of the plots and will have arrived in the plots by moving slowly through the sediment. In all plots studied, recovery rates of older adults (3C age groups) were slow and amounted to maximally 0.2 during the first two years (Table 1). The higher values after longer recovery periods arose mainly from younger animals entering the 3C age group rather than from migration of old animals.
Samplings after the subsequent summers mostly showed the densities of new-born 0-groups (from larval settlement) to amount to several hundreds per m2. These initial densities tended to be higher within than outside the plots, as shown also in Table 1 (see the often significantly >1.0 ratios for 0-group Macoma after periods including at least one summer period). The correspondence with results reported in Table 1 shows that the plot chosen for the example of Fig. 3 was representative of the course of recovery in Macoma.
To summarise: recovery of Macoma populations in the disturbed plots took place by three different processes, viz. (1) larval settlement in late spring and summer, (2) juvenile settlement in winter and early spring and (3) slow immigration of adults (probably year round).
3.4. The special case of Harmothoe
The recovery rate of Harmothoe is likely to de-pend on that of Arenicola because on the Wadden Sea tidal flats Harmothoe lives only in the tubes of adult Arenicola (Wolff, 1973). Our observations corroborate this relationship between the two species. Harmothoe numbers were significantly higher at high than at low Arenicola densities. On average, about half of the lugworm tubes contained a specimen of Harmothoe. The positive relationships between the two species (Fig. 4A) were statistically significant (Spearman rank tests with n D 18: p < 0:02 and <0.01 for within-plot and outside-plot, respectively). The relationships observed inside and outside the

The two best-fitting linear regression lines are indicated (within-plot data: broken line, Harmothoe D 1C 0:47 Arenicola; outside-plot data: stippled line, Harmothoe D 2 C 0:49 Arenicola). (B) Relationship between the density of adult Arenicola within the plots (in number per 0.5 m2) and the completeness of the recovery in Harmothoe (expressed as the ratio of densities observed inside and outside the plots). The horizontal broken line indicates the 1.0 level of complete recov-ery of Harmothoe, the vertical broken line the mean density of Arenicola in the surroundings of the plots. Same data as used in (A), but to avoid odd ratio values, points were entered only if >1 Harmothoe was found in the samples taken in the surroundings of the plot. A best-fitting non-linear regression line is indicated. The relationship is statistically significant (r D C0.82, p < 0:02, Spearman rank test with n D 9).
246 J.J. Beukema et al. / Journal of Sea Research 42 (1999) 235–254
plots (Fig. 4A) were almost identical, which means that other factors than lugworm abundance were prob-ably irrelevant for the establishment of Harmothoe densities. Only when adult lugworms within the plots had reached an abundance similar to that outside the plots did the Harmothoe densities within the plots reach levels similar to those in the surroundings of the plots (Fig. 4B). The slow recovery of Harmothoe is therefore not likely to have been caused by, pos-sibly, low dispersal ability (which is in fact not poor at all: specimens of Harmothoe were observed in fair numbers in the net catches, see Section 3.6) but by the slow recovery of the populations of adults of its host.
3.5. Abundance overshoots
More than half of the species studied at least once showed a numerical density that was significantly higher within one or more plots than in the surround-ing areas. Substantially elevated densities within the disturbed plots can be considered overshoots in the recovery process. They were particularly frequently observed in the spat densities of Macoma and Mya and in the densities of small worms (such as Py-gospio and Capitella) and in the juveniles of several worm species with large adults (Table 1: Arenicola, Nereis). Of course part of the significant differences can have arisen by chance (a maximum of 5% of all differences tested for significance at an 0.05-level). Actually, the overshoots were much more frequent than expected purely by chance. If all values are omitted from older age groups from Table 1, the significant overshoots numbered 38 out of 336 tested ratio values, of which a maximum of 0:05ð336 D 17 could have arisen by chance. The difference between the number observed (38) and maximally expected overshoots (17) is highly significant (2 test). This difference becomes even larger (viz. 46 vs 17.4) if the observations on Pygospio and Capitella are in-cluded. Thus, the frequent occurrence of overshoots must have been a real phenomenon.
It is noteworthy that the occurrence of overshoots was certainly not limited to short-lived opportunistic (r-selected) species such as Pygospio and Capitella. Table 1 rather shows the opposite, viz. that over-shoots were particularly frequent in the juveniles of long-lived (K-selected) species such as Arenicola, Macoma and Mya.
3.6. Macrobenthic species observed in the water column
Apart from epibenthic crustaceans (mostly shrimps Crangon), Macoma was by far the most numerous species found in the net catches in the main tidal stream. Mostly tens and often hundreds of juvenile Macoma (up to 9 mm shell length) were caught per 20-min nettings in winter and early spring. In summer, numbers could be even higher (sometimes thousands per 20 min), but these were only small postlarvae (mostly up to 2 or 3 mm). No other bivalves were caught in any substantial numbers.
Worms were also frequent in the net catches, in particular juvenile (and a few adult) Arenicola and adults of Harmothoe, Eteone, Phyllodoce and Ne-merteans, but no Scoloplos. However, egg-cocoons of Scoloplos (and also once of Phyllodoce) were caught in early spring. We frequently observed swimming adults of Eteone above the tidal flats in winter.
4. Discussion
4.1. Duration of the recovery process
Any estimate of the time to complete recovery depends on the criterion used. In the present paper, species richness was already restored almost com-pletely after a few summer months (Fig. 1A), as was the total number of individuals of all species together (Fig. 1B). Total biomass, however, needed almost three years (including at least three summers) to reach a level that was no longer different from the areas surrounding the formerly defaunated plots (Fig. 1C). Even after four or more years, the fauna of the plots was still characterised by a lack of large specimens of long-lived species such as Mya and Ma-coma. As judged from the numbers of year marks on their shells, old Macoma were (almost) absent. Year marks are less clear in Mya, but very large speci-mens of this species were never encountered within the plots during the 4-year observation period. Be-cause many large infaunal animals are unable to move (e.g. adult Mya), the time to complete restoration in-cluding normal age distributions may be as long as the longevity of the most long-lived species in the com-munity, i.e. more than a decade in the Wadden Sea. A
J.J. Beukema et al. / Journal of Sea Research 42 (1999) 235–254 247
study of a community phenomenon such as recovery from disturbance should thus last sufficiently long to include at least one turnover of its most long-lived constituent members (Connell and Sousa, 1983).
The order of achievement of complete recovery we observed (first species richness, then total nu-merical abundance and finally total biomass) was also found by Bonsdorff (1983) in a shallow brack-ish water area in the Baltic Sea. As in our study, initial recovery was rapid in summer, but complete recovery took at least some five years.
In the defaunation=recovery experiments reported by Dittmann et al. (1999), which were highly com-parable to the present experiments (using also large plots on a Wadden Sea tidal flat), results were sim-ilar, viz. a high degree of recovery in numbers of species and individuals of macrobenthos within a few summer months. Unfortunately, they did not include estimates of biomass changes, but their pe-riod of observation would certainly have been too short to include full recovery of biomass. As in the present experiments, the re-establishment of the macrofauna proceeded faster if the recolonisation started in spring than in autumn.
Another similarity between the present experi-ments and those reported by Dittmann et al. (1999) is that the species composition of the recovering community hardly differed from that of the sur-rounding undisturbed area. Only the initial stages were dominated by small worms (including some species usually designated as opportunistic pioneer species) and juveniles of bivalves, whereas large and deep-living specimens were initially absent within the recovering plots. Our long-lasting observations reveal that such animals reached the usual densities of the surrounding tidal flats only after several years.
Thrush et al. (1996) performed similar experi-ments with defaunated plots of 0.2 to 3.2 m2 on an exposed sandflat in New Zealand and found nu-merical recovery still incomplete after 9 months. They judge this rate of recovery unusually slow. It was influenced by wind-driven wave disturbance, negatively affecting in particular the stability of the sediments of the bare plots and less so of the sur-roundings which were covered by dense tube mats formed by spionid polychaetes. In the present exper-iments, the tidal flats were not strongly exposed to waves or currents.
Many more examples are available on faster re-covery (within hours, days or weeks instead of months), but they all refer to very small defaunated plots of <0.1 m2 or even in the order of 0.01 m2, e.g. Bell and Devlin (1983), Savidge and Taghon (1988), Frid (1989) and Smith and Brumsickle (1989).
4.2. Repopulating mechanisms
Various dispersal mechanisms have contributed to the recovery of the benthic communities in the dis-turbed plots, as shown above for Macoma (Fig. 3). The generally higher re-population rates in summer than in winter point to the significance of the repro-ductive season and the important role of recruitment of early benthic stages originating from pelagic lar-vae. Increased abundance in winter, a long time after the season of primary settlement, points to secondary settlement of late postlarval, juvenile, or even adult stages. Also, such phenomena as the gradual fad-ing of the initially clear-cut borders of the plots, as visible from the abrupt disappearance of lugworm castings (shown in fig. 1 of Flach, 1992a, and fig. 3 of Flach and De Bruin, 1993), point to short-distance movements by adults.
4.2.1. Settlement of pelagic larvae By far most benthic species in tidal-flat areas and
estuaries in western Europe reproduce in spring, pass through a pelagic larval stage and settle as early postlarvae in late spring or summer (Wolff, 1973). High concentrations of larvae of all common species in the Wadden Sea water are almost restricted to the summer half-year (Heiber, 1988). After a short period of growth, they generally turn up in the sieve samples in the course of summer. Though we did not try to catch larvae, we assume that substantial numbers of nearly all species mentioned in Table 1 arrived in the plots in this way. Indeed, total or juvenile densities increased in particular in summer in nearly all species.
As some species, however, lack a pelagic larval stage and show direct development (e.g. Arenicola, Phyllodoce, Scoloplos and Corophium), they can-not cover long distances in the larval stage. They must either have arrived at a later juvenile stage (as observed in Arenicola, see below), have originated from adults that had immigrated to the plots already
248 J.J. Beukema et al. / Journal of Sea Research 42 (1999) 235–254
at an earlier time (e.g. swimming Corophium), or have been transported as eggs (e.g. the cocoons of Phyllodoce and Scoloplos are only weakly attached to the sediment and can break loose). Though Es-sink et al. (1989) and Janklin and Günther (1996) report the occurrence of Corophium in the water of tidal streams in the Wadden Sea, we found only few specimens in our nets. This may have been because we hardly ever fished at night, when several benthic species are known to emerge from the sediment (e.g. Dean, 1978; Dauer et al., 1982).
4.2.2. Immigration of juveniles In addition to the importance of the summer sea-
son for recovery in most species, processes occurring in winter (a period when larvae are rare in the water) were important in at least two species. Substantial numbers populating the plots already in the first win-ter following mat removal in autumn were observed in Arenicola (Table 1) and Macoma (Table 1, Fig. 3) and were all juveniles of several months old. Lower numbers entering the plots in winter were found in Phyllodoce, Eteone, Scoloplos, and Corophium (Ta-ble 1, first column) and these included both juveniles and adults.
The infaunal species that entered the plots in win-ter in substantial numbers must have had a highly mo-bile juvenile (postlarval) stage and may be expected to appear also in samples taken by nets suspended in tidal streams adjacent to tidal flats. By far the highest numbers observed in such net samples taken in winter were juvenile Macoma (as also observed by Beukema and De Vlas, 1989, and Beukema, 1993). Pelagic juveniles of Arenicola also occurred frequently and abundantly in the net samples (as also reported by Beukema and De Vlas, 1979, and Flach and Beukema, 1994). These observations of high numbers of juve-niles of Macoma and Arenicola suspended in the wa-ter of the tidal streams explain (1) why the juveniles of exactly these two species were already present in the plots at the end of the first winter in densities close to those found around the plots (Table 1, first column), and (2) why these two species were exceptional in showing higher recovery rates after a full year than after a summer only (Table 1: substantially smaller ratio values at S than at either W C S or S C W in juvenile Arenicola and 1-group Macoma and not in other species).
Drifting of bottom animals in the water above tidal flats of the Wadden Sea occurs the year round on a large scale and has been observed in juveniles or even adults of most benthic species. Armonies (1994) observed particularly high numbers of juve-niles of Scoloplos, Cerastoderma, Macoma, Ensis, Crangon, Carcinus and Hydrobia (in this species also adults) and also several times high numbers of Eteone and Nereis. Günther (1992) reviews the ev-idence for dispersal of benthic stages of intertidal macro-invertebrates and lists no less than 24 Wad-den Sea species of bottom animals that have been observed in the water column or in traps catching suspended animals. This is a large number, includ-ing more than half of the macrozoobenthic species that can frequently be found in bottom samples taken on tidal flats of the Wadden Sea. After this review, additional publications have appeared (Com-mito et al., 1995; Olivier and Retière, 1998) with similar evidence, including subtidal benthic commu-nities. Thus, a high proportion of benthic species display considerable dispersal capacity during their postlarval benthic life stages. Therefore, arrival on defaunated plots will not have been limited to set-tling larvae in most species, but will regularly have included resettling of older stages that had already adopted a benthic way of life. In species without a pelagic larval stage (such as Phyllodoce, Scolop-los and Corophium), postlarval juvenile and=or adult dispersal by tidal or wind-driven water movements above the tidal flats may have been the main way of migration into the plots.
Drifting in the water column can be an efficient way of dispersal in the sea. In the Wadden Sea, tidal currents are strong enough to transport suspended animals in one 6-h period over distances of >10 km. For example, Beukema and De Vlas (1989) provide evidence that offshore North Sea areas are populated in this way by Macoma originating from high coastal tidal flats and are transported over distances of tens of km as spat of several mm length.
4.2.3. Immigration of adults Movements of adults above tidal flats of the Wad-
den Sea by long-distance tidal-stream transport occur in several species. In the German part of the Wadden Sea, Janklin and Günther (1996) observed drifting adults of Eteone, Phyllodoce, Corophium and Hy-
J.J. Beukema et al. / Journal of Sea Research 42 (1999) 235–254 249
drobia in spring and summer. Further references on migrating adults can be found in Günther (1992).
In the water of the Balgzand tidal streams, we found only low numbers of adults of such large worms as Arenicola, Nephtys and Nereis. The slow appearance of adults of such worms in the central parts of our plots (Table 1) is in accordance with their near-absence in the water of the tidal streams. The few adults of these species that colonised the plots may have arrived by infrequent swimming of short distances above the tidal flats. Conversely, rela-tively high numbers of adults of such small worms as Eteone, Phyllodoce and Scoloplos appeared rapidly within the plots and these species were well repre-sented in catches in suspended nets (pers. observ.; Janklin and Günther, 1996).
Adults of several infauna species may also move through the sediment or at the surface. Such move-ment will always be rather slow and over short dis-tances. In Arenicola movement through the sediment apparently occurs quite frequently, as can easily be deduced from the gradual appearance of castings of large worms within the plots but always only near the edges. Schuitema (1970) measured distances moved by adult cockles and found small (up to 10 cm) net displacements in most specimens within a ten-week observation period. At such speeds, hardly any indi-viduals would be able to reach the central parts of the plots within a year. Indeed, cockles of more than one year old were observed only after two summers and had grown up from cockle spat that had settled slightly more than one year earlier.
Occasionally, we observed wind-driven transport in adults of some species of bivalves rolling over ex-posed tidal flats at high wind speeds (>7 Beaufort). During a 30-year monitoring of the benthic fauna at 15 sites on Balgzand (see e.g. Beukema and Cadée, 1997), we incidentally found a few specimens of Cerastoderma or Macoma that could not have grown up at the site of observation (owing to the pattern of the year marks on their shells). Observations of small clusters of Mytilus edulis displaced by wind or ice were more frequent. From such observations and the low speed of recovery of adult bivalves (Table 1) we conclude that this way of transport can play only a minor role in the re-population of defaunated tidal-flat areas of >1 m2.
4.3. Mechanisms leading to abundance overshoots
During the recovery process, overshoots of to-tal numerical densities inside the plots were a fre-quently occurring phenomenon (Fig. 2) and several species contributed to such overshoots (the italic significantly >1.0 ratio values in Table 1 plus the numerous observations in Pygospio and Capitella reported in Section 3.2.3). During the comparable experiments in the German Wadden Sea reported by Dittmann et al. (1999), such overshoots were ob-served in juveniles of the small polychaetous worms Polydora sp. and Pygospio elegans. Substantial over-shoots in the initial phases of faunal recovery of azoic sediments were observed in members of the genus Capitella by e.g. Grassle and Grassle (1974), McCall (1977), Jaramillo et al. (1987) and Ragnars-son (1995). These examples from the literature all refer to small worms, generally considered oppor-tunistic species, responding to a favourable situation created by the disturbance. Their densities often de-cline rapidly after the peak (as in the above Capitella examples), which may point to either a response to the exhaustion of the resource or to a usual sea-sonal decline. In our frequently taken samples during the first summer of recovery, both Pygospio and Capitella declined in autumn simultaneously inside and around the plots, thus primarily showing a usual seasonal change. However, these declines tended to be somewhat steeper inside the plots (where sum-mer densities were usually higher) than in their surroundings. As Thistle (1981) rightly remarks, it is difficult to decide whether the occurrence of tempo-rary overshoots in disturbed patches results (a) from rapid and temporary responses by adapted species (the real opportunists with rapid reproduction and dispersal) to temporary extra resources in disturbed patches (such as better food supply or the presence of decaying organisms), or (b) from species that are not specialised in this way but that merely survive better in the absence of adult congeners and other competitors for such resources as space and food. The latter species should not be called opportunists, though they temporarily show abundance patterns that resemble those of real opportunists.
In our experiments so many species (more than 50%) showed the overshoot phenomenon that they cannot all be considered short-lived opportunistic

species. Several of them were young stages of typi-cally long-lived equilibrium species with large adults such as Mya arenaria (compare Table 1). Apparently, in a high proportion of the species (and not only in a few typically opportunistic species) recruitment was more successful in the still sparsely populated areas of the plots than in the well-occupied surroundings. Results of experiments by Flach (1992a,b, 1996) provide evidence that such overshoots may result from species interactions, with inhibition in the sur-roundings rather than facilitation within the plots as the predominant underlying mechanism. By restock-ing parts of defaunated plots (similar to those used in the present study) with various densities of adults of other species (including Arenicola, Cerastoderma, Macoma and Nereis), Flach (loc. cit.) found differen-tial recovery rates in several species of macrobenthos if lugworms Arenicola marina and=or cockles Ceras-toderma edule had been added. Settlement in the parts restocked by either or both of these two species was invariably lower than in parts of plots without lugworms or cockles. Moreover, the relationships be-tween the densities of the restocked species and those of the newly arrived species were generally signifi-cantly negative. In Arenicola the negative effects on other species (including their own juveniles) started already at rather low densities (about 15 per m2) and increasing inhibition of other species was observed at increasing densities of adult lugworms (Flach, 1992a,b). Lugworms appear to impair other species by their bioturbative activities. These disturbing ac-tivities can be very intense on Wadden Sea tidal flats (Cadée, 1976). In the present study, inhibitory densi-ties of lugworms were frequent in the surroundings of the plots, but turned up within the plots only af-ter some years of recovery. In Cerastoderma clear inhibitory effects on other species became appar-ent only at relatively high densities of >100 adults per m2 (Flach, 1996), not frequently occurring in the surroundings of the plots we used. Therefore, we think that the observed overshoots were caused mainly by the low Arenicola densities within the plots, resulting from the slow recovery of adult pop-ulations of this species and taking more than four years to reach densities that equalled those in the surroundings (Table 1). Consequently, disturbance of newly settled animals from sediment reworking by lugworms was less within the plots than in their sur-
roundings for periods of several years. Flach and De Bruin (1994) studied this type of disturbance in great detail in Corophium and found that it caused flight responses, followed by resettlement elsewhere and increased predation. Jensen (1985) also found that high densities of Cerastoderma promote migration in Corophium. Enhanced migration by the sediment-disturbing actions of cockles and lugworms will have reduced densities of disturbed species in areas sur-rounding the plots and may have promoted densities of such species within plots by the arrival of animals driven from the surrounding areas.
The initially low abundance of lugworms within the plots will thus have favoured the settlement of several species. However, we also found one exam-ple of a species (Harmothoe) whose colonisation of the plots was retarded by an initial near-absence of adult Arenicola (Fig. 4). Though Arenicola is not really an ‘early succession’ species, its relationship with Harmothoe abundance could nevertheless be considered an example of colonisation facilitation (Hall et al., 1994). Reise (1983) found that the pres-ence of Arenicola had a positive effect on several meiobenthic species living in lugworm tubes on tidal flats of the German Wadden Sea. Other examples of colonisation facilitation by the presence of other species are shown by Gallagher et al. (1983) on an intertidal sandflat in Puget Sound and by Thrush et al. (1992) on an intertidal sandflat in New Zealand. Gallagher et al. (1983) found strong facilitation by tube building worms and also by simulated tubes. They conclude that the results of their experiments point to facilitation rather than inhibition as the dom-inant process governing succession. Other published studies (e.g. Whitlatch and Zajac, 1985; Soster and McCall, 1990), however, arrive at the opposite con-clusion. In our experiments, we also found very few examples of facilitation within the recovering plots, but many of inhibition (though within the plots these were clear only after the introduction of lugworms in parts of the plots). However, the community we studied contained few tube-building animals. Ap-parently, the composition of the community studied determines which mechanism dominates the course of recovery of disturbed communities. From results of simulation studies, Zajac and Whitlatch (1991) arrive at a similar conclusion.

4.4. Extrapolation to larger areas
Most results published on the recovery process of defaunated areas refer to small-scale (a few metres at most) and short (usually <1 year) experiments. Hall et al. (1994) compare reports on recovery times of disturbed patches over a wide range of sizes and show that recovery periods are longer when plots are larger: from less than a few months at patch sizes of <1 m2 to generally several years at patch sizes of >100 m2. Several examples are known of very rapid (within hours, days or weeks) recovery of the benthos of small (in the order of 0.01 m2) disturbed patches (e.g. Bell and Devlin, 1983; Savidge and Taghon, 1988; Frid, 1989; Smith and Brumsickle, 1989; Ragnarsson, 1995), while larger disturbed plots (in the order of 10 or 100 m2) need months or years (Dittmann et al., 1999; present study). Reasons why small patches can completely recover within shorter periods are their higher edge-to-surface ratio and shorter distances from the edges to the centre. Species or life stages of species with poor dispersal capacities can usually move at low speed and nev-ertheless rapidly enter empty spots along the edges. In accordance with this expectation, Whitlatch et al. (1998) observed in the spionid polychaete Boccardia syrtis a higher adult=juvenile ratio in small than in large defaunated plots in the early stage of coloni-sation. Within our plots, we observed higher ratios of thick to thin casts of lugworms Arenicola marina along the edges than in more central parts.
We are not aware of any experimental study at a larger scale than about 100 m2. Therefore, pre-dictions from experimental results of faunal recov-ery after such large-scale disturbances as frequently caused by anoxia or red tides have to include ex-tensive extrapolation. Sound predictions by such up-scaling from results of small-scale experiments are feasible only if sufficient knowledge is available of underlying processes (e.g. species interactions) and mechanisms (e.g. dispersal). Unfortunately, relevant characteristics differ widely from species to species (Shull, 1997) and our knowledge of such controlling factors in recolonisation is rudimentary (Zajac et al., 1998).
One of the generalisations that appears to be war-ranted is: as early life stages in most species show better dispersal power (by a pelagic life style), re-
covery of numbers of species and individuals will mostly be rapid during the months after spawning, i.e. in summer at the latitudes where nearly all stud-ies have been executed. This will be true both for small and large areas, though small patches can also easily be repopulated by slowly moving benthic stages or by passive wind- or current-driven bedload transport (most prevalent in windy seasons and not in summer). Thus, another generalisation is that small defaunated plots (and the edges of large plots) will primarily be repopulated within a short time by post-larval stages and not typically in summer (Smith and Brumsickle, 1989; Günther, 1992), whereas (central parts of) large plots will be recolonised predomi-nantly by larvae in specific seasons. Of course, there are species with large dispersal capabilities extend-ing to postlarval stages. Species such as Arenicola and Macoma with benthic stages actively leaving the sediment to be transported in huge numbers over dis-tances of several km (Beukema and De Vlas, 1979, 1989) can be observed in similar densities in cen-tral and marginal parts of large plots. Such species, however, are too exceptional to invalidate the above generalisation. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that life histories, dispersal capacities and way of dispersal differ from species to species and that such differences can affect the course of colonisation events (Shull, 1997).
Proper comparisons between such generalisations from experimental studies and results of studies of actual recovery following large-scale (in the order of km2) defaunation are not easy. In most cases of defaunation resulting from anoxia, the low-oxygen events tend to occur repeatedly and the recovery of the benthic community does not usually reach a ‘mature’ stage (several examples in Diaz and Rosen-berg, 1995). Other disturbances are of an even more chronic nature, such as those caused by intensive use of heavy bottom trawls. The initial recovery stages prevailing under such conditions are generally characterised by the rapid appearance of short-lived rapid-growing prolific species with large numbers of pelagic larvae. Santos and Simon (1980) observed a more important role of larval than older-stage set-tlement in most taxa (including the large groups of polychaetes and molluscs) in a shallow subtidal area of 3 km2 in Florida after annual total defaunation by anoxia. In some (but not all) taxa, a strong sea-
252 J.J. Beukema et al. / Journal of Sea Research 42 (1999) 235–254
sonal influence on recovery was observed in this area (Simon and Dauer, 1977). In this case, the above generalisations on the role of pelagic larvae and sea-sonality were largely corroborated. Strong evidence of the effect of the season on the recovery process is also shown by Powilleit and Kube (1999), who followed the recovery after an anoxic event that oc-curred as late as August, i.e. after the season of larval settlement. They observed a slow recovery and an unusual absence of rapid establishment of abundant populations of opportunistic species.
In several other cases of disturbances causing de-faunation, the sediment composition was changed in such a way that it hampered faunal recovery, e.g. by the persistent presence of oil (Kuiper et al., 1984), organic material from effluents (Rosenberg, 1976), or extremely fine settled material (Van der Veer et al., 1985). Therefore, even results of large-scale recovery experiments will often be only of limited value for predictions of the course of events after large-scale defaunation. Fortunately, such ex-periments also provide a wealth of new insights into the life history of benthic species and various eco-logical problems at the population and community level (as also remarked by Bonsdorff, 1983).
