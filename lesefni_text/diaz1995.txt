Introduction
Oxygen is a key element in me metabolic processes of fishes and invertebrates. Although oxygen concemration in the sea can be much lower than saruration, respiration in most marine invertebrates does nOI appear to be significantly affected until extremely low concen-

trations are reached. For many benthic invertebrates this concentration is about 2mll- 1 , or
even less (Herreid 1980, Rosenberg et aI. 1991). Hypoxic and anoxic basins are well known features of the world's oceans (Richards 1965,
Kamykowski & Zeotara 1990). In general, the Pacific and Indian Oceans have lower dis­ solved oxygen concentration and greater areas exposed to hypoxic water than the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. I; for further delails see. Richards 1957. Wyrtki 1966, Kamykowski & Zentara 1990 and references therein). Hypoxia and anoxia are usually associated with lhe boltom, but an Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) can occur at intennediate depths in lhe water column, typ­ ically in the open oceans or along coastlines. In some deep-sea areas the OMZ can impinge upon the bonom, exposing fauna to sleep gradients of dissolved oxygen (Thompson et al. 1985. Wishner et al. 1990, Levin et at. 1991).
Hypoxic and anoxic environments are Dot recent phenomena. There is an extensive liter­ ature on paleoenviro'nmental records of ancient oxygen related biofacies. mainly due to an inlerest in recoostnlcting ancient marine basins (see Savrda & Boltjer 1991 and olhers in Tyson & Pearson 1991a).
All marine sediments are anoxic below a certain depth from the sediment surface and, consequently, sulphidic sediments have a worldwide distribution. The boundary zone sepa~
rating surficial sediments dominated by aerobic processes from subsurface anaerobic domi­ nated sediments is defmed as the redox potential discontinuity, RPO (FencheI1969). Oxygen penetrates by physical diffusion only a few millimetres into the sediment in muddy and silty habitats (Revsbech et al. 1980). but burrowing and irrigation activity of infauna can distrib­ ute oxygen much deeper inw the sediment (Aller 1982). Other factors that affect the position and thickness of the RPD are: oxygen content of bottom water, sedimentation of organic mat­ ter, sediment grain size, and temperature (Fenchel & Riedl 1970, Pearson & Rosenberg 1978, Vismann 1991).
In the absence ofoxygen, microbes can utilize other compounds as electron acceptors, i.e. NO)". MnOA, FeOH, sol-, and CO2 which are reduced to N2, Mn2 +, FeH , HS-. and CH4 ,
respectively. Sulphide, in the fonn of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), because of its wide occur­ rence and high toxicity to metazoan life, is the most important of these reduced compounds generated by bacterial metabolism in anoxic sediment. The combined effects of hypoxia and H~S on marine organisms are difficult to separate (Vismann 1991). Since hypoxia and H2S generally occur together and both stress marine organisms, it is likely that their effects are at least additive. Some meiofaunal organisms are, however. pennanem inhabitanLS of the sul­ phide biome in anoxic sediments (Fenchel & Riedl 1970), and colourless sulphur bacteria are commonplace in oxygen and hydrogen SUlphide micro-gradients (J0rgensen & Revsbech 1985).
Organic sediment enrichment occurs through vertical and advective accumulation of organic carbon. On bottoms where accumulation is predominant. oxygen may be reduced to low concenlrations. This occurs mainly in enclosed sea areas, or where water column strat­ ification causes stagnant conditions. In such areas the highest oxygen demand can be in the water close to the bortom rather than in the sediment (Rydberg et al. 1990). Hypoxia is often seasonally associated with the peak in the annual temperature cycle, which occurs around August in the northern hemisphere (Rosenberg 1980).
The increasing input of anthropogenic nutrients to many coastal. areas over the past several decades has been suggested as the main contributor to more recently declining trends in bottom water oxygen concentrations (Turner & Rabalais 1994). In the Adriatic Sea, for example, hypoxia has reached its present state gradually over a period of about 20 years as a direct result of increased phytoplankton blooms that increased the sedimentation oforganic matter (Justic

1987). This "new" primary production locally increases the flux oforganic carbon to the bot­ 10m (Wassmann 1990, lustic et al. 1993) and increases oxygen demand at the bottom, first through baclerial and then other metazoan respiratory processes (Oraf et al. 1982). In the pres­ ence of a stralified water column, a gradiem of declining oxygen concemrations will result from a combination of water column and benthic oxygen demand setting up hypo1>ic condi­ tions. Before mortality, animals will show different levels of tolerance or resistance. In a hypoxic zone, stress on benthic animals may be shown in various ways, for example by exhib­ iting altered behavioural panerns. decreased feeding and reproduction activity, and by changes in physiological functions (see reviews by Vernberg 1972, Davis 1975, Herreid 1980). It has also been demonstrated. in a model by Pearson & Rosenberg (1978), how benthic communilies generally are distributed and how their feeding mode changes in relation to organic enrichment and changing o1>ic-anoxic conditions in the sediment.
Oxygen deficiency may very well be the most widespread anthropogenically induced del· elerious effect in me marine environment that causes localized mortality of benthic macro· fauna. Over the pasl 1010 15 years the number of coaslal areas with seasonal hypoxia in the bonom waler has spread rapidly and the main cause for this is suggested 10 be eutrophication (Rosenberg 1985, Colombo et aI. 1992. Vollenweider et aI. 1992, lustic et al. 1993, Orel et al. 1993). A future global warming may accelerate these effects and enlarge the areas that are affected (Kennedy 1990. Beukema 1992). Table 1 lists the areas experiencing oxygen defi­ ciency and reporting benthic effects.
Up to the 1950s. mass monality of marine animals caused by lack of oxygen was summa­ rized by Brongersma-Sanders (1957). The imponance of oxygen as an ecological factor for maintaining populations, of mostly fisheries related species. is emphasized in early reviews. such as Davis (1975). He reviewed oxygen requirements of Canadian freshwater and marine species with the intention of determining water quality criteria relalive to minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations.
Our objective in this review is to evaluate the ecological importance of hypoxia and how it alters benthic community structure and energy flow processes. Our examples are drawn bOlh from field and experimental data. We will show that benlhic macrofauna have a rather high tolerance to hypoxia and that many species reaCI to declining oxygen concentration with various behavioural responses before they eventually die. This review concentrates on ben­ thic macrofauna. but a few comparisons with meiofauna are made. The literature on ecolog· ical effecls of hypoxia and anoxia on meiofauna is limited (but see Coull 1969, Tietjen 1969. Elmgren 1975, Van Es et aI. 1980, losefson & Widbom 1988, Murrell & Fleeger 1989. Levin et al. 1991, Coull & Chandler 1992, Hendelberg & lensen 1993). Overall, it seems thai meiofauna in general are less affected by hypoxia and anoxia than macrofauna and megafauna.
Terminology and measurement
The lenninology of oxygen deficient environments varies between geologists. physiologists. chemists, and ecologists. A recent and thorough review or this subject can be found in Tyson & Pearson (199Ia). In our review we use the terms hypoxia and anoxia to defme low oxygen environments. We found thai these were me most widely used terms in the ecological and physiologicalliterarure. Hypoxia begins at 2.0mll- 1 of oxygen and extends to O.Omll~l. the point ofanoxia. Approximate equivalencies for comparison with olber oxygen units (at 20psu

(practical salinity units, equal to '?'co), 25°C, 1 atmosphere pressure) are: 1mil-I = 1.4mgl- 1
= 1.4 ppm = 23.9mmHg = 23.9torr = 3.18kPa = 45.7mM = 89.3mgatl- 1 = 4.3% 02 vol. = 14 % air saturation. For shallow estuarine or marine habitats, normal dissolved oxygen concemrations range from 100% air saturation (about 8-10mU-1), to 2.0mn- l . For this review, we consider this range 10 be normoxia. For comparison, atmospheric oxygen con­ centration is about 200mlr I • When expressing oxygen concentration as percentage satura­ tion, we refer to air saturation as 100%. Saturation concentration in the sea is dependent mainly on temperature, salinity and pressure (water depth and in experimental situations, bar­ ometric pressure). Solubility of oxygen in water is reviewed by Kester (1975) and solubility tables are presented in Weiss (1970), Colt (1984) and Benson & Krause (1984).
The measurement ofdissolved oxygen is complicated by the reactive narure ofoxygen and is still mainly based on the Winkler method (Winkler 1888). His method remains the stand­ ard for calibration of modem dissolved oxygen sensor technologies, with improvements to the original method of Winkler increasing the accuracy of dissolved oxygen measurements. Polarographic oxygen electrodes have made the in situ field measurement of dissolved oxy­ gen possible. For recent examples see Sanford et al. (1990), Diaz el a1. (1992), Summers & Engle (993) and Rabalais et a1. (1994). Microelectrodes (Revsbech & J0tgensen 1986) and other emerging sensor technologies are advancing rapidly, which should make the measure­ ment of oxygen more reliable and precise (Gundersen & J0rgensen 1990). It is not the pur­ pose in this review to describe and evaluate different methods for measurement of dissolved oxygen (for this see Gnaiger & Forstner 1983).
Because of the relationship between hypoxia, primary production, and water temperarure, it may be possible to use satellite sensors to predict if conditions favourable for the formation of hypoxia will occur. Leming & Srunu: (1984), using data from the Coastal Zone Color Scanner, found a correlation between surface chlorophyll concentrations and areas of bottom water hypoxia on the inner Louisiana-Texas continental shelf. This Iype of remote sensing for idemifying potential hypoxia "hot spots n around the world seems promising, but must be critically evaluated. Rabalais et aI. (1991) found no relationship between surface chlorophyll concemrations and bottom hypoxia. Other remote sensing techniques for detecting the pres­ ence and ecological consequences of hypoxia and anoxia involve the use of sediment profile cameras, which provide in situ vertical section photographs of bottom sediments. Sediment profile cameras and surface cameras have been used to map the areal extent of hypoxic bot­ toms in several systems (Rhoads & Germano 1982, 1986, Valente et a1. 1992, Rosenberg & Diaz 1993).
Most srodies of hypoxia and anoxia that profile the water column report strong declining gradients of dissolved oxygen and nutrients within the benthic boundary layer. (Rosenberg & Lao 1988, Gundersen & J"'rgensen 1990). Within this layer, rorbulence and eddy diffusion provide the energy for mixing (Wright 1989). At the sediment/water interface there is a thin diffusive boundary layer. approximately 1nun thick, through which molecular diffusion is the dominant transport mechanism for dissolved materials (Gundersen & J0rgensen 1990). In addition to water column demands, benthic biological and chemical oxygen demands accel­ erate the consumption of oxygen within these boundary layers. An example of a strong ver­ tical oxygen gradient is found in the Limfjord, Denmark, where oxygen concentrations were 6.0, 2.9 and D.4mJI- ' at 0.5, 0.3-0.2, and 0.05m above the bottom, respectively (Jergensen 1980). Exceptions to this monotonic declining trend in dissolved oxygen were shown by Rabalais et al. (1994) for the Louisiana shelf. Many of their profiles show a slightly elevated level ofoxygen at lhe sea bed, then a decrease above the sea bed and then an increase towards the surface. This apparent anomaly is likely related to photosynthetic production ofoxygen at

the sea bed by benlhic primary producers (Rabalais et aI. 1994). If the eventual effects on the fauna are to be correlated wilh the prevailing oxygen concentralion, lhen oxygen must be precisely measured in lhe microhabitat in which the animals live.
Measurement of oxygen close to the bottom can best be obtained by in situ use of oxygen electrodes. Moreover, long-term continuous recording of dissolved oxygen is essentiallo evaluate the field effects of hypoxia and anoxia on benthic fauna. Continuous recordings by reliable oxygen electrodes are preferred to measurements at intervals because periodic and aperiodic oscillations in oxygen conceDlration occur in many habitats (Sanford el al. 1990, Diaz et al. 1992. Summers & Engle 1993). Single point measurements of oxygen can be par~
ticularly misleading for interpreting biological effects in shallow, well mixed systems thal experience diurnal cycles. Often, measurements should also be made at night during the time of lowest oxygen concentration (Summers & Engle 1993). Even when hypoxic and anoxic water masses that develop in deeper water appear temporally stable, inlernal waves or wind driven seiches can result in aperiodic intrusions of low dissolved oxygen waler into adjacent normoxic habitats (Sanford et al. 1990, Breitburg 1992).
The ecological effects of hypoxia and anoxia on benthos appear to be a function of the amplitude and temporal variation in oxygen concentration as well as the absolute oxygen concentralion. Diurnal and semi-diurnal internal tides on the summit (730-Soom) of the Vol· cano 7 seamount in the easlern Pacific displaced waler masses and exposed the benthos to pericx1ically varying low oxygen (range of O.OS--Q.16mn- I
). rather than to constant hypoxic conditions. This small difference in oxygen was sufficient to elicit a strong faunal response (Levin et al. 1991). In most field studies. however, the magnitudes of temporal and spatial changes in hypoxia are not known. When the history of hypoxic exposure is not known, infaunal effects should nOl be ascribed to a panicular oxygen level (Rosenberg et al. 1992).
Effects of benthic hypoxia on marine communities
In this section benthic community and population level responses (species. abundance, and biomass) induced by oxygen deficiency are summarized. The first section deals with the response patterns along oxygen gradients, and mortality in relation to declining oxygen levels in fjords. estuaries and near coastal areas. Open coaslal areas. the Black Sea. and the Baltic proper will be discussed in the second section and a discussion of oxygen minimum zones comprises a third section. Faunal behaviour in relation to declining oxygen concen· Irations and recovery of organisms subsequent to improved oxygen conditions will be dealt with in separate sections.
There is a complicated interplay between oxygen concentration and sediment geochemis­ try that regulates the response of organisms to declining dissolved oxygen concentrations. For example, prolonged hypoxia or anoxia allow sulphate·reducmg bacteria. typically found deeper in the sediments during nonnoxia, to survive in surface sediments where they can produce potentially lethal concentrations of hydrogen sulphide (1ergensen 1980. Bagarinao 1992) and alter other geochemical cycles.

(Rosenberg et aI. 1992). In areas that experience seasonally varyinghypo~a (estuaries and open coasts) the critical oxygen concentration is closer to O.7mW I (Llans6 1992), with the reduction from 0.7 to O.4mW I being particularly imponant (Uans6 & Diaz 1994). The difference in faunal response between these two rypes of environments is related to the stability and duration of hypoxia.
Norwegian fjords with poor bottom water circulation typically experience lowest oxygen levels in November (Rygg et at 1985). Hypoxia and anoxia in these fjords are not necessar·

ily associated with increased organic enrichment, but this might be a factor in some instances. In the Langesundfjord, for example, the benthos at the deepest sites (> 100m) dis­ played patterns of species, abundance and biomass (SAB curves) most consistent with stress from seasonal anoxia that could be related to organic enrichment (Gray et a1. 1988). The organic enrichment- and low oxygen-tolerant Hereromasrusjili[ormis (Rosenberg 1976) was the most abundant species at the deep hypoxic stations (Gray et al. 1988).
Organic enrichment of the Oslofjord, Norway, bas created a gradient of oxygen stress that has worsened through time. Prior to 1900 there is little evidence of low oxygen problems in the iImer Oslofjord, che Bunnefjord, with the area supporting a commercial fishery for Pan~ dalus borealis. By 1915, Petersen (1915) found a deep station in the inner Bunnefjord to be depauperate. Other stations in the middle Oslofjord, the Vestfjord, had well developed com~
munities. The deep waters (>75m) in the Vestfjord have declined in oxygen from 2.8mll- 1
in the 1930s, to 1.7m1r 1 in the 1960s, toO.9mlr ' in the 1970s (Mirza & Gray 1981). These areas with declining oxygen values have reduced benthic communities. Annual renewal of at least part of the bottom water, however, maintains communities at a pioneering successional state with high abundance of opportunistic species (Mirza & Gray 1981).
The Skagerrak coast of western Sweden has many semi-enclosed fjordic areas that expe­ rience hypoxic or anoxic water below the halocline for most of the year. Significant declining trends in bottom water oxygen concentrations have been demonstrated for several of these basins since the 19505 and 1960s (Rosenberg 1990). Comparison ofinfaunal communities in three of these fjordic areas between 1976 and 1986 showed significant reductions in: (a) total mean abundance and biomass (excluding some large and rare species), (b) abundance and biomass of molluscs, and (c) abundance of suspension feeders and carnivores. Community similarity also changed between the two periods (Josefson & Rosenberg 1988). Hypoxia was recorded in these areas, but no detailed information is available concerning oxygen concen~
tration prior to the two sampling periods. The authors stated that the reductions were most likely due to hypoxia induced by large-scale eutrophication.
In the Gullmarsfjord, the largest of the Swedish fjords, the yearly minimum oxygen con­ centration has declined gradually over the years in the deeper areas, but remained above 2mn- 1 until 1980. During the winter of 1979-80, oxygen levels dropped to exceptionally low values. In November 1979 oxygen concentration was 0.83 mll~ 1 and continued to decline to a low in January 1980 of 0.21 mll- l (temperature: 5-6°C) at 115m depth. The macroben­ thic communities were fairly stable in abundance and biomass from 1977 up to November 1979, but by January 1980 the entire macrobenthic community was eliminated (1osefson & Widbom 1988). Meiofauna did not seem to be affected at the same station in January 1980, but later that year, when the bottom water had been reoxygenated, meiofauna diversity was reduced (Austen & Widbom 1991). The reduction of macrofauna was abrupt and occurred after oxygen concentrations declined below 0.83mll- 1 . A combination of factors was respon­ sible for the apparent lack of a gradual response and subsequent threshold response of the infauna. The communities had been pre-stressed by previous years of seasonal hypoxia with sensitive faunal groups (echinodenns and crustaceans) already absent, or in low abundance, prior to 1979. The low temperatures (5-6°C), also tended to increase tolerance to low dis~
solved oxygen of the pre-stressed community. Shallow bouoms (I5-30m) in the inner pans of the Gullmarsfjord, the Saltkiillefjord,
were heavily affected by organic enrichment and subsequent periodic anoxia in the 1960s. The benthic macrofauna was reduced at some stations and missing at others (Leppiikoski 1968). While recordings ofoxygen concentrations were not made, it was inferred that lack of oxygen was responsible for the differences in fauna.

Figure 2 Number of species, abundance and biomass (wet weight) in relalion to declining oxy­ gen concentrations with depth. Example from a persistent anoxic fjord, the Byfjord Sweden (modified from Rosenberg 1977).
The Byfjord on the Swedish west coast is permanently anoxic below I5-20m water depth. The number of species. abundance, and biomass of macrofauna in the Byfjord decline with depth, which itself was highly correlated with declining oxygen concentrations (Rosenberg 1977) (Fig. 2). The temporal and spatial stability of the vertical gradients in oxygen concen­ trations bas led to strong faunal gradients in the Byfjord. Among the species listed by Rosen­ berg (1977) as abundant in hypoxic fjord habitats are: Phoronis mulleri, Ophiodromus flexuosus. Scalibregma inflatum, Polydora ciliata, Nassa reticulara, Aporrhais pespelicani and Corbula gibba.
In Lough Ine. a sea loch in Ireland lhat experiences annual hypoxia and anoxia, Corbula gibba is the most hypoxia tolerant species. Below 30m only C. gibba survived past August and by September no macrofauna were present. Mass monality induced by the summer hypoxic/anoxic water eliminates benthos below about 25 ro, but recolonization occurs during the winter. Dominant species in t:l::te severe hypoxic habitats are Pseudopolydora pulchra and Corbula gibba. which recolonize by pelagic larvae (Kitching el al. 1976).
In the innermosl pan of a fjord in the Shetland Isles, Sullom Vee, Pearson & Eleftheriou (1981) found that seasonal development of a thermocline could result in hypoxic bottom con· ditions. During hypoxia in the summer of 1977 in thaI area all macrofauna died with the exception of C. gibba.
Large areas (330km2) of the Limfjord in Denmark experience periodic summer hypoxia. The oxycline can be sharp with high values (> 5.7 mil-I) at O.5m above the bottom but only O.4mW I at O.05m above the bottom (Jelrgensen 1980). Benthic fauna experience pulses of annual mass mortality and recolonization. High densities of the sulphur bacteria Beggiatoa spp. were also found 10 cover muddy bottoms throughout the year with average biomass of

5_20gm- 2 (Jmgensen 1977). The presence of Beggiatoa spp. is indicative of sulphide diffusion into surface sediments and at least some oxygen in the near bottom water.
Kiel Bay, an inlet to the Baltic, has seen a significant declining trend in deep-water oxygen concentrations since the 1950s (Weigelt 1990). It was not until late summer of 1981 (salinity 20-26psu, temperature 1O_14°q, however, that a severe oxygen reduction occurred in all pans of Kiel Bay and Mecklenburg Bay (Ehrhardt & Wenck 1984). Anoxia and H2S were widespread below the halocline at depths >20m (Weige1l1991). The anoxia lasted for sev­ eral weeks and resulted in mass mortality of the benthic infauna. An estimated 30000 tormes (99% of the 10tal biomass) of macrofauna were lost over an area of about 750km2. Other hypoxic-anoxic events in 1967 and 1983 were not as widespread, or as detrimental to the fauna, with losses of about 65-67% over smaller areas (600_700km2
) (Weigelt 1991). Among the few survivors of the hypoxia-anoxia were Arctica islandica, Astarte spp., Cor­ bula gibba, and Halicryptus spinulosus (Weigelt & Rumohr 1986, Weigelt 1987). Arntz (1977) found Astarte elliptica, Mya truncala, and Arctica islandica to be panicularly resistant to hypoxia in that region. Currently the dominant faunal groups in Kiel Bay are hardy hypoxia-anoxia tolerant bivalves and the priapulid Ha!icryptus spinulosus (Weigelt 1987, 1991). All the long-term declines in macrofauna within the Kiel Bay syslem have been attrib­ uted to oxygen depletiQn. Most of the species that increased following the 1981 oxygen event were either hypoxia tolerant or had opportunistic life histories (Weigelt 1991).
In a general review of the benthic ecosystem in this pan of the Baltic, Arntz (1981) described how declining oxygen concentrations can result in "ecological catastrophes". Arntz (l981) found the deepest benthic habitats to be extremely sensitive 10 hypoxia for two reasons; this is where hypoxia first develops and the distribution of deep dwelling, long-lived equilibrium species tends to be restricted to these bottoms. While hypoxia is not a problem above the halocline, the salinity at shallower depths is too low for the survival of these equi­ librium species. The physical stability of deeper high salinity habitats is an imponant factor in the development of these advanced successional comnnm.ities (Rhoads 1974, Rhoads & Germano 1986, Schaffner 1990), which also may be the most sensitive to hypoxia.
The shallow Cabbage Tree Basin in Pon Hacking (southeastern Australia) is a relatively pristine estuarine ecosystem that experiences brief periods of hypoxia and anoxia when high freshwater inflow or temperature stratifies the water coIwnn. Hypoxia was first recorded in 1951 and may be a naturally occurring phenomenon (Rochford 1953, in Rainer & Fitzhardinge 1981). Rainer & Fitzhardinge (1981) determined that hypoxia and anoxia were the most imponant factors in limiting species distributions. Along the declining oxygen gra­ dient, biomass and average community structure parameters, except evenness, declined. Changes in substratum characteristics or depth could not account for these community pat­ terns. Four of 49 species that occurred at a 5m deep station, which experienced hypoxia of near 10% saturation, were common. At the deepest station (8m), which went anoxic, none of the 11 species present occurred in high numbers. The mean biomass at the anoxic station was 1.6 gwwm-2 • 35gv.rwm-2 at the hypoxic station, and 290 gwwm-2 at a nearby nor­ moxie station.
In Tomoe Cove, a small semi-enclosed cove on the nonhwest coast of Amakusa Shimoshima Island, Japan, oxygen concentrations dropped dramatically during summer stratification (July and August) at about 10m depth. Minimum oxygen concentrations of 10% saturation were measured at depths of 10m and a temperature of 27°C . Subsequently a high sulphide content (O.75mgg- l ) was recorded in the surface sediments and the samples smelled of H2S. The benthic faunal abundance and number of species decreased sharply during the hypoxic period and at the peak of hypoxia no macrobenthos was recorded (Tsutsumi &
256
MARINE BENTHIC HYPOXIA
Kikuchi 1983, Tsutsumi 1987). The polychaetes Capitella capitata, Pseudopolydora spp., and Prionospio cirri/era, and the bivaIve Theora fragiUs quickly recolonized defaunated areas after hypox.ia. These species are not considered especially tolerant to oxygen defi­ ciency, rather they are suggested to be opportunists with life history traits that facilitate re­ colonization of vacant habitats (Gray 1979). In summary, the benthic fauna was eliminated al an oxygen saruralioD < lO'I' that prevailed for some weeks.
Megafauna of the deep fjordic Saanich Inlet in British Columbia experience hypoxia « 1.0mn- l
) and anoxia for much of the year. Annual flushing reoxygenates the inlet and produces a complicated nonnoxic-hypoxic-anoxic mixrure throughout the 220m water col­ umn (Tunnicliffe 1981). The megafauna assemblages exposed to hypoxia maintain a higher diversity and abundance than does much of the upper photic zone. Peaks of faunal abundance occurred at 75 and 100m. which corresponds to the edge of the bypoxic water. This boundary effect or edge effect. of increased abundance is common in oceanic and coastal OMZS (Mull­ ins el al. 1985). In Saanich Inlet, however. diversity within the hypoxic zone (85-loom, < I.Omll- 1 for half the time) was also high. This is DOt a condition seen in other OMZs (Mull­ ins et al. 1985, Levin et aI. 1991). Persistence of a megafaunal community of high abundance and diversity in Saanich Inlet is pertinent to behavioural and physiological adaptations that allow survival in hypoxia and anoxia. Regulation of competitive dominance in this substra· tum-limited coaununity through anoxia-induced monality (Tunnicliffe 1981), and not food quality, may be most imponant in maintaining high diversity.
Oxygen concentrations <2.9m.U- 1 have been reported in about 40 9Ii of the 130 eslUarine and near coastal areas througbout the continental USA that have adequate data (Whitledge 1985). We know, however, that benthic fauna can generally tolerate oxygen concentrations down to at least 2mll- 1 wilbout major effects. But every major estuarine system within the USA has areas thai seasonally experience mild to severe hypoxic or anoxic conditions. How­ ever. persislenl bypoxic or anoxic conditions have not been reported from any US estuarine or coastal system.
Relative to hypoxia, Chesapeake Bay is the most slUdied system in North America. New­ combe & Home (1938) were the first to report recurring oxygen depletion in the deeper por­ tions of the Chesapeake. This now appears to be related to the long-term development of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. initiated by European senlement in the seventeenth century (Cooper & Brush 1991). The spatial distribution and severity of hypoxia and anoxia vary from year to year and are related to a combination of factors, including meteorology and the amount of freshwater runoff, both of which directly affect the magnitude of primary produc­ tion and the stratification of the water column (Officer et aI. 1984. Seliger et al. 1985). In the main stem of Chesapeake Day, hypoxic conditiOn! persist through the late spring and sum­ mer until autumn winds cause vertical mixing and tum--over of bottom water.
Seasonal defaunation andlor declines in benthic abundance have been recorded by Holland et al. (1977. 1987) during seasonal hypoxia in Chesapeake Bay. This recurring sea­ sonal hypoxia, in the upper mesohaline Chesapeake Bay, has been linked to the decline in abundance of larger. more long-lived benthic species (Holland et al. 1977. 1987) and the dominance of the benthos by smaller short-lived species (Mountford et al. 1977).
The deeper waters of the major tributaries of Chesapeake Bay experience periodic hypoxic events that can last from days to weeks (Haas 1977, Kuo & Neilson 1987. Diaz et al. 1992). By periodic hypoxia we mean short-term or intermittent hypoxic events that last on the order ofdays and reoccur at irregular times of the year. The factors that cause these peri~.:vents
vary from tributary to tributary (Kuo & Neilson 1987). In the York River the strength of tidal mixing regulated by the spring-neap tidal cycle is the principle factor (Haas 1977). In the Rap-
257
ROBERT J. DIAZ & RUTGER ROSENBERG
pahannock River, and probably the Potomac River, a combination of tidal mixing and the proximity to the main stem hypoxic waters. which supply oxygen deficient bottom water to the tributaries. are the principle factors (Kuo & Neilson 1987, Kuo et al. 1991).
The ecological consequences of periodic hypoxia are varied. This type of less temporally severe hypoxia may be a mechanism for regulating benthic population dynamics (Breitburg 1992, Dauer et al. 1992, L1ans6 1992). In the Rappahannock River. L1ans6 (1992) found temporal and spatial patterns in macrobenthic abundance and species composition to be related to intermittent hypoxia. Communities were dominated by opponunistic polychaete species. and lhe magnitude of response to hypoxia was species specific. Streb/ospio benedicti and Mediomastus am!Jiseta became extinct locally with the onset of severe hypoxia, while Loimia medusa and Paraprionospio pinnata were present in affected habitats through recur­ ring hypoxic events. L1ans6 (1992) also found that the timing of hypoxia relative to recruit­ ment was critical to survivorship. The summer recruitmem peaks for Podarkeopsis levifuscina and Pseudeurythoe paucibranchiota both declined with the onset of an hypoxic event. The intensity and duration of hypoxia are also faclOrs that can affect population dynamics (L1ans6 1991).
In the York River, periodic hypoxia at depths >9m is less severe ilian Rappahannock River hypoxia and mat;:robenthic community strucrure does not appear to change spatially or temporally in response to hypoxic events (Dauer et aI. 1992, Diaz et aI. 1992). This may be due to the long-term conditioning of the community by hypoxia stress. The dominant species are now those known to be tolerant 10 low dissolved oxygen (Llans6 1991, 1992. Neubauer 1993). In the 1960s the York River macrobenthic community at 10m was dominated by Nephrys incisa. Acteocina canaliculaJa. and Micropholis otra, but by the mid·1970s euryhaline opportunistic Paraprionospio pinnara and Pseudeurythoe spp. were dominant (Boesch et al. 1976). In pan, long-Ierm changes documented in the York River macrobenthic community may be due to hypoxia.
Demersal fishes and the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, quick.ly repopulated areas after periodic hypoxic events in the York River (Pih1 et al. 1991). SquiIliJ empusa remained in the deep hypoxic areas until their tolerance was exceeded. at which point they migrated to and remained in shallow water. Food availability seemed to be the main reason that motile spe­ cies would Stay or return [0 hypoxic walers (Arntz 1981, Pihl et al. 1992). During hypoxic events, infaunaI prey such as Microplwlis atra, Leplosyanapta tenuis and spionid polychae­ tes were seen to migrate 10 the sediment surface, and spionid polychaeles were also seen swimming in the water column, probably in response to hypoxic suess (Diaz et al. 1992). The movement of infauna to the sediment surface was also seen during more severe hypoxia in the Rappahannock River (Llans6 1992).
The successful exploitation of oxygen stressed infauna in the York River by bottom-feed­ ing predators is related to the level of hypoxia (O.2-O.8mll· 1
), its short duration (6-14 days), and the relatively small area affected (only depths >9m). The larger scale hypoxia and anoxia thaI develop in the upper Chesapeake Bay do not allow for such a "positive" energy transfer. In these areas macrobenthic community structure is drastically affected (Holland et al. 1987) and utilization of the stressed habitats by invertebrates and fishes do not occur again until the autumnal turnover.
Over the past 30 years there has been a gradual. but variable. increase in the pool of hyp6x:ic water that seasonally develops in the upper Chesapeake Bay with the intrusion of hypoxic water onlO shallower bottoms (Officer et aI. 1984, Seliger et al. 1985, Seliger & Boggs 1988). At the fringe of the hypoxic water mass, shorHerm variability in dissolved oxygen concentrations is associated with large amplirude wind- and tide-forced lateral inter-

nal oscillations of the pycnocline (Sanford et al. 1990). This results in the advection of more saline hypoxic water onto the shallower (3-17m) bottoms of the Bay. Mobile fauna quickly move out of the advected hypoxic waters, but not all individuals successfully escape (Breit­ burg 1992). Breitburg (1992) found that a number offactots, including age and behaviour, reduced me mobility or increased physiological susceptibility to hypoxia. Hypoxia stress, then, can act as a selective force upon populations. Aperiodic stress from the intrusion of deep water hypoxia OntO shallower bottoms will result in more eurytopic communities. This is a community response that is similar to those seen in response to the periodic hypoxia in the York River.
The presence of a eurytopic community is not always strictly related to a single stress factor. From the 1950s, gross sewage and heavy metal pollution of Los Angeles- Long Beach Harbours, California, resuhed in hypoxia and anoxia in the iruter portions of these harbours (Reish 1955, Reish et al. 1980). While oxygen concentration was undoubtedly a factor in the observed community changes, it was not possible to distinguish it from the effects of pollution.
The inner and middle continemal shelf of the northern Gulf of Mexico (from the Missis­ sippi River delta to the Texas border) is the largest area in North America affected by hypoxia (Rabalais et al. 1991). An area of 8000-9500km2now experiences seasonal summer hypoxia. Hypoxic bottom waters are found at depths from 5 to 60m and can extend up to 20m above the bottom (Rabalais et aI. 1991). Although possibly the first occurrence, hypoxia was first recorded in the summer of 1973 between 6 and 37m on the central Louisi­ ana continental shelf (Harper et al. 1981). The hypoxic layer extended 2-7 m above the bot­ tom and contained areas that were anoxic. A reduction in the abundance of benthic fauna was observed during this event, but it was not until the summer of 1978 that hypoxia caused extensive mortality (Harper et al. 1981). Hypoxia has occurred almost annually since 1973; extensive mortalities and low trawl catches were reported for 1979 (Pavela et al. 1983), 1981 (Gaston 1985), 1982 (Leming & Stuntz 1984), 1983 and 1984 (Renaud 1986b).
The 1981 hypoxia in this area dramatically reduced many of the numerically dominant macrobenthic species (Phoronis milileri, MediomastuJ californiensis, Cirralulus cf. fili­ tormis). Species richness was also lowered by hypoxia, with the elimination of many amphi­ pod and some polychaete species (Harper et al. 1981. Gaston 1985). Defaunated bottoms were quickly recolonized after hypoxia by Paraprionospio pinnaJa (Gaston 1985. Harper et al. 1991). In general, the community composition of the hypoxia-stressed bottoms of the Louisiana-Texas shelf has shifted to a younger, smaller sized, short-lived fauna.
The coast of Texas is only aperiodically affected by hypoxia (Harper et al. 1981, Rabalais et al. 1991). In the summer of 1979 (May-August), a hypoxic event occurred during a 10ng­ term benthic monitoring programme of the inner Texas continental shelf (1977-84, Harper ct al. 1981). This provided detailed insight into how hypoxia affects inner continental shelf benthos. The phytoplankton bloom, which produced the organic maner that fuelled this hypoxia, is thought to have originated on the Louisiana shelf and moved wesl with prevailing currents (Harper et aI. 1991). A tropical stann broke up the hypoxia in August. In sub­ sequent years hypoxia did not occur, but there was a declining trend in minimum oxygen concentration that ended with a brief period of hypoxia in 1983. During the 1979 hypoxia, divers smelled hydrogen sulphide in bottom waters, and observed dead infauna lying on the sediment surface and bacterial mats covering large areas of the bonom (Harper et al. 1991). Motile species appeared to have migrated away from the affected habitats and not to have suffered mortality (Pavela el al. 1983). This is no! always the outcome. Another b1oom­ associated hypoxic event occurred off Galveston, Texas, in June 1984 which caused mortal­ ities of mOlile fishes and crabs (Harper & Guillen 1989).

Prior to the 1979 hypoxia on the Texas shelf, the dominance of Paraprionospio pinnata was declining and Ampelisca agassiZi populations were increasing. Hypoltia men eliminated Ampelisca and post-hypoxia outbreaks of Paraprionospio pinnaJO briefly dominated the benthos. Deeper offshore habitus (21 m) experienced mild hypoxia, as low as 1.1 mll- I , with high macrobenthic monaliry but recovered within a year. In slightly shallower nearshore hab· itats (15m) hypoxia was severe, with oxygen values as low as O.5mlr l
, and me occurrence of mass macrobenmic mortality. Recovery of nearshore communities did not occur within a year. The original polychaete dominants were reduced in abundance and a succession of sev· eral different taxa followed, each of which was dominant for one to three months. This pat­ tern persisted for two years after the 1979 severe hypoxic event. At shal10wer nearshore habitats, Paraprionospiopinnata and omer polychaete populations were low after initial poSt· hypoxia peaks, possibly as a result of shrimp predation. The 1980 shrimp catch was one of the largest recorded and many of the numerical dominants in the nearshore habitats were mol­ luscs, which are less susceptible to Shrimp predation than polychaetes (Harperet al. 1991).
Offshore areas
The Black Sea, with an average deplh of 1270m, is the largest mass of "namraBy occurring" permanently anoxic water on Earth. About 90% of its 5.4x1OS1cm3 volume is anoxic begin­ ning at depths of 150-25Om. Below about 100m, the Black Sea is permanently hypoxic (Caspers 1957, Bacesco 1963, Zenkevitch 1963). The Ukrainian northwestern Black Sea shelf is critically eutrophic with increasing frequency of phytoplankton blooms over shallow shelf seas (Tolmazin 1985, Mee 1992). Periodic hypoxia and anoxia is widespread encom­ passing all of the Sea of A20v and up to 95% of the Ukrainian northwestern shelf. These periodic evems are distinct from the permanent anoxic layer and lead to mass monalities of benthic populations which colonize the area during normo,uc periods (Zaitsev 1991, 1993) (Fig. 3). In 1991. anox..ia along the Romanian coast eliminated an estimated 50% of the demersal fish populations. Since the 19605 increasing hypoxia and anoxia bave been blamed for the replacement of the highly valued demersal fish species with planktonic omnivores. Of the 26 commercial species fished in the 1960s only six still suppon a fishery (Mee 1992).
Macrobenthic fauna occupy about 23 % of the tota! area of the Black Sea (Caspers 1957, Zenkevitch 1963). The lower depth limits for macrobenthic tife in the Black Sea are 125 00 in the western region, 115-12400 in the northwest region, 127-13500 off the Crimea, 135-16500 off me Caucasus, 130-135m off the south coast, and 170-200m off the Bosph~
rous. Polycbaetes are the group penetrating 10 greatest depths in the hypoxic water followed by molluscs. Crustaceans are poorly represented except in shallow waters. Zenkevitch (1963) and Bacesco (1963) list the following species with me deepest distribUtions: Modiola phaseolina 180m, Amphiura stepanovi 165m. Nephtys hambergi 162m, followed by Cerian­ thus veslirus, Melinna palmala, Terebellides stroemi, Abra alba, O1rdium simile, Mytilus galloprovincialis, and phoronids extending down to about 130m. Bacesco (1963) concluded that only a few molluscs occurred below 120m depth, and only polychaetes were found below 150m. The most tolerant taxa were syllid worms and Nephtys hombergi, followed by Terebellides stroemi and Melinna palmala. Biomass of infauna declines dramatically below about 100m depths (Bacesco 1963) (Fig. 3). Biomass was close to zero deeper lhan 130m, below an oxygen concentration of 1.4..Q.9mll- I , at temperatures of 8_9°C and salinities of 17 and 23psu. Mass mortalities of benthic fauna, e.g. Mya arenaria, have also been reponed from shallow areas. These reductions may be due to toxic algae or to oxygen deficiency

(Gomoiu 1983). The deep areas of the Caspian Sea also have low ox.ygen concentrations. Zenkevitch (1963) repons that benthic biomass is very low (often a fraction of 1 gwwm-'1) in depositional areas where oxygen is low.
A trend of declining oxygen concentrations was documented from the 1930s to the late 1960s in the deep basins of the Baltic Sea (Fonselius 1969). Beginning in lhe 1960s and last­ ing up to the present, large deep bottom areas of lhe Baltic Sea have been mostly permanenlly hypoxic or anoxic and devoid of benthic macrofauna (Andersin et 31. 1978). Below lhe halo· cline, at about 70m, approximately lOOOOOkm'1 of the bottom is more or less pennanenlly hypoxic. No significant change in the bottom water o;tygen content has occurred up to 1993. Low salinities (7-16psu) below the halocline also contribute to the reduced number of marine species in these areas.
Andersin et al. (1978) described a general reduction of the benthic communities in the

central Ballie basin (Baltic proper) up to the mid·I970s. The general decline in depth distri· bution of the fauna of the Gulf of Finland is illustrated in Figure 4. It bas been speculated mat !he biomass "missing" in me anoxic areas may be about 1.7x106 tww (Rosenberg 1980). Elmgren (1975) described me changes in number of species, abundance and biomass of both macro· and meiofauna along the deplh gradient of declining oxygen concentrations. He nOted a gradual decline in me macrofauna towards deeper bonoms containing less dissolved oxy­ gen. The common Baltic polychaete Harmothoe sarsi, however, appears partiCUlarly resist­ ant 10 hypoxia (Andersin et aI. 1978). The number of meiofauna taxa was higher than for macrofauna al all sampling depths >45m. The proportion of nematodes, the most hypoxia and anoxia tolerant meiofaunal taxon (Hendelberg & Jensen 1993), increased with depth.
Periodic hypoxia in lhe mesohaline (13-17psu) Bornholm Basin in the south Baltic was reponed from 1948 to 1971 by Tulkki (1965) and Leppakoski (1969, 1971). These authors described how benthic communities were reduced and even eliminated during periods of hypoxia or anoxia and how bottoms were recolonized following a subsequent return of nor· moxia. The species most tolerant to hypoxia, usually the only species to be found at a station, were: Astarte borealis. Halicryptus spinuiosus. Scotopios armiger and Capitella capitOla. In addilion to these, Leppakoski (1971) lists the polychaetes Heteromastus filiformis and Trochochaeta muttisetosa as tolerant of hypoxia. It may be possible that some of mese species colonized the area following a temporary increase in oxygen. Leppakoski (1969) did find, however, thaI all individuals ofAstane borealis collected from 1963 to 1967 were old, implying mat they survived the periodic hypoxic events.
The bottom water in me Kanegat. between Denmark and Sweden, has been affected by armual late summer-aurumn hypoxia since 1980. During hypoxic years the oxycJine was sharp, with lowest oxygen values close to the bottom (Rosenberg & Loa 1988, Rosenberg et al. 1992). In September 1988, the WOfSt year on record, approximately 3000km2 of the bot­ tom was hypoxic and hypoxic water extended up to about 20m above the bottom. Macrobenthos was frequently affected at depths around and below the halocline at 16-22m. In some years, abundance and biomass were reduced to low numbers by mass monality (Rosenberg & Loa 1988. Baden et a1. 199Oa). Table 3 shows heavy monality and poor recolonization of infauna at a 22m deep station during and following hypoxia. The oxygen

These measurements sug-gest thai the benthos were exposed to concentrations of about tmW\ of oxygen about two months prior 10 sampling late in September 1988. Shon-tenn oscillations in oxygen concen-tration over that period cannot, however, be excluded. The species lhat best survived this hypoxic event were the bivalves Archca islandica and Corbula gibbo, the polychaetes Herer-omasrus filifonnis and Myriochere sp., and the phoronid Phoronis miUleri (Table 3).

A 37m station in the Kauegat, dominated by two brittle stars, was sampled in October and November 1985 (30 days apan). Fishermen reponed dead Nephrops norvegicus in that area in the middle of that period when the oxygen concentration was 1.8mll- 1 about I m above the bottom, but probably less at the bottom (see Rosenberg & Loo 1988 their Fig. 2). During this episode Amphiurafilifonnis was significantly reduced in abundance and biomass, whereas A. chiajei was nOI. This suggests that A. [iiiformis is more susceptible to low oxygen concentra­ tions than A. chiajei (Rosenberg & Loo 1988).
In October 1987 dead Abra alba were photographed lying on the surface with their valves open and mantle edge visible, indicating recent monality. The oxygen concentration at that time was 3.4mll- l
. During grab sampling one month earlier. most of the population was alive, but some recently dead specimens were noted. The oxygen concentration was then O.8mW I (Baden el al. 1990a). The flDding of recently dead bivalves in OClOber was most probably a result of the low oxygen concentrations prior to the sampling.
The examples given above show localized effects at some sites in the Kattegat. However,

in September 1988 bonom trawling was conducted at 12 stations in the Kanegat over an area of approximately 3000km2 where the oxygen concentrations were approximately Imlr 1
(15% saturation). Each trawl, which lasted 1h, caught 200-400kg of dying infauna. indicat­ ing large scale effects of hypoxia (Baden et al. 1990a).
In 1984,24 of Petersen's stations sampled in 19J2 in the Kauegat were resampled for macrofauna. Total biomass was significantly reduced in the northern and western Kattegat, and in general the majority of species were found to be smaller in size in 1984 compared with 1912 (Pearson et al. 1985). This may be an effect of increasing periodic hypoxia in the area. In 1989, some of these stations were resampled by Josefson & Jensen (1992). They recorded a 70-80% reduction in biomass and poor recruitment compared to the 1984 survey at four stations where oxygen concentrations in 1988 had been < 1roW I . Overall, temporal varia­ lion in benthic communilies in the Kanegat was greatest where the seasonally most severe hypox.ia occurred (Rosenberg et aI. 1992).
The Norway lobster (Nephrops norvegicus) population was aIso affected by the hypoxia in that area. In 1984. rather high catChes were recorded (mean IOkgh- 1
) where oxygen concemrations were >2mJl- l . Following that year, oxygen concentralions during sum­ mer-autumn dropped below 2m11- 1 and poor catches were recorded. From September 1988 onwards no lobsters were found in the south Kattegat (Baden el aI. 199Oa). The diet of demersal fish in that area changed with declining oxygen concentrations. During periods of oxygen deficiency the consumption of epibemhic crustaceans was reduced and shifted towards a greater proponion of hypoxia-tolerant infauna! species (PihI1994).
In the North Sea, west of Denmark and the German Bight, seasonal bonom water hypoxia was recorded below the summer thermocline in August 1981, 1982, and 1983. The hypoxia lasted aboul four weeks each year. with September storms dispersing the hypoxic water masses. The severity of hypoxia increased each year (Rachor & Albrecht 1983) with oxygen concentrations dropping to <0.7mlr 1 by 1983. In 1981, mass mortality of epibenthos was observed near the Danish west coast: (Dyer et a1. 1983), but no effects on macrobenthos were observed (Rachor & Albrechl 1983). During the 1992 hypoxia, Dethlefsen & Westemhagen (1983). Westemhagen & Dethlefsen (1983) and Dyer et aI. (1983) documented widespread acme monality of epibenthos. In 1983, macrofauna was reduced by as much as 30-50% in some affected areas (Niermann el al. 1990). During the hypoxic years communities were dominated by species such as Mage/OM spp. and Edwardsia spp. The long-term reduclions in populations ofNucuJa niridosa and Abra nirida in the German Bight appear to be relaled to the worsening hypoxic conditions (Rachor 1985).
The oxygen concentration in the bottom water of the Adriatic Sea declined between 1911 and 1984 (Justic 1987).10 September 1983 a severe hypo;c;.ic event occurred with day-{o-day reduclion in benthic species as documented photographically by Stachowitscb (1984. 1991). The area affecled was eSlimated to have been at least 2S0km2• and biomass was estimated to have been reduced by 20,57,80 and 93% over the first four days of the hypoxic event (Fig. 5). The most resislant species were the anemones Ragacris pulchra and Calliaclis parasitica, which normally are attached to shells of hermit crabs. High temperatures (about 18°C) may have been an imponant factor in the rapid monaIity seen. The detailed repom of Slacbow· itsch are. unfortunately, nOI accompanied by oxygen recordings.
An area of the Mediterranean Sea that now experiences annual hypoxia and anoxia is Elef­ sis Bay at !.he north end of Saronidos Gulf, Western Aegean Sea. Elefsis Bay is a semi­ enclosed embayment of 67km2• Nutrients discharged from the Keratsini Athens sewage out­ fall and industry sources cause severe ecological stresses in the Bay. By 1973, hypoxia and anoxia were occurring in the deeper areas. below about 30m. from July through August

(Friligos 1976). By 1977 the annual summer hypoxia and anoxia had more than doubled in me area, and bouoms as shallow as 20m were affected. Hypoxia and anoxia are now the pri· mary faClors regulating seasonal changes in benthic communities and the timing of annual recruitment in affecled areas. On average, 16 species per O.2m2 recruited into habilatS expe· riencing anoxia, while nonnoxic habitatS recruited 61 species perO.2m:!. However. lhe mag­ nitude of recruitment was similar in oxygen stressed and normoxic habitatS at abom 5100-6100 individuals per m-1 (Friligos & ZenetOs 1988).
Oceanic and continental slope environments
The eastern Pacific is .characterized by a shallow mixed layer (Wishner et aI. (990) and a pronounced oxygen minimum {Wyrtki 1966). In 1988, the core of lhe OMZ «O.5mll- l) around the Volcano 7 seamount intersected me botlOrn from a depth of 70 to noom, with lowest oxygen «0.1 mil-I) from 300 to lI00m. OMZ bottom boundaries are regions of enhanced biological aclivily. The enhanced flux of high quality, undegraded organic mailer 10 the bottom under an OMZ is panly due to primary production sinking through midwater depths where hypoxia has reduced populations of midwater consumers (Gowing & Silver 1983). When upwellings are associaled wiLh lhe OMZ Ihere is also an increase in primary pro­ duction (Walsh 1981). This high organic matter flux typically supports an unusually high abundance of benthic species !hat are tolerant 10 hypoxia (Wishner et al. 1990, Levin et aI. 1991).
AI the edge of an O~Z, benthic fauna experience steep gradientS in oxygen and organic maner. Along the California coast north of Point Conception, Hyland et aI. (1991) found thai communities in muddy sediments on the shallow edge of the OMZ, in Lhe Sanla Maria Basin in 1.3 mil· I of oxygen, had less lhan half the abundance and species of nearby normoxic sta­ tions wilb oxygen levels of 2.7m11-1 • Deeper into we OMZ (O.6m11- 1), abundance and spe­ cies number were funher reduced to about one·fourth of the normoxic stations. Along lbe edge of the central Califomia coastal OMZ, off Point Sur, Mullins et al. (1985) found increased biogeochemical activity. Macrofauna and benthic foraminiferans displayed edge effects al both lhe upper and lower OMZ depth boundaries (Fig. 6; Mullins et al. 1985). The lowesl oxygen measured was 0.27 mIl·1 at 700-750m (Broenkow & Greene 1981 in Mullins el al. 1985). The primary factor responsible for this faunal distribution panero (edge effect) is Ihe hypoxia. but Mullins et aI. (1985) hypothesize combinations of bottom currents, bac­ terially mediated nutrient recycling and food supply are also imponant controlling faclors. Levin et aI. (1991), at the Volcano 7 seamount, found that megafauna and macrofauna were severely reduced in a near-anoxic zone «0.1 mil-I), bUljust tens of metres in depth from that near-anoxic area, the fauna attained high abundance in a severe hypoxic zone {O.ll-o.16mll-1). These authors found that populations of microbes aDd meiofauna, except harpacticoids. reached peak abundance within the near-anoxic zone.
Orf Polol Sur, California. the boundaries of the OMZ (O.5mll- l) occur at 500-525m and 1000-1025m. These boundaries have been temporally and spatially stable for at least Ihe pasl 25 years (Mullins et aI. 1985). Data from Volcano 7 from 1984 and 1988 indicate similar sta· ble OMZ conditions (Wishner et al. 1990). Sampling eight times from 1986 10 1989 in the OMZ (0.6mll- ' ) of the Santa Maria Basin, California. Hyland et aI. (1991) delermined that communities were stable and had lower variation in community SlrUClUre through lime when compared with DOrmoxic communilies a12.7mll"l oxygen just above the OMZ.

ArntZ & FahTbach 1991 and references therein) and serves as a model system for hypoxic and anoxic effects on benthos. Generally, oxygen is <0.8mll-\ from 20 to 700m depth. Enrichment of the bottom by sedimentation of high quality organic matter leads to enhanced benthic biomass in hypoxia from 2.0 to about 0.6mll- 1 (80m). Below about O.2mn- ' • mac­ robenlhic biomass was reduced, but microbial biomass (Thioploca spp.) increased (Rosen­ berg el al. 1983). Beyond 7oom, Thiel (1978) found deep-sea benthic biomass off Peru to be higher than in other non-upwelling areas, possibly a result of downslope transport of organic matter. Fish catches are negatively correlated with occurrence of filamentous bacteria and positively correlated with macrobenthic biomass. Benthic and demersal fish biomass increase above and below the hypoxia (Rosenberg et aI. 1983).
The temporal and spatial stability of dissolved oxygen within upwelling and OMZ systems, combined with a supply of high quality organic matter appear to be a key in successfuJ adap­ lation of fauna to hypoxic conditions (Rosenberg et al. 1983, Mullins et at. 1985, Forbes &
Lopez 1990, Levin et al. 1991). The imponance of high quality organic matter in the devel­ opment of benthic communities under upwellings and OMZS can be seen in the modifications of the original Rhoads & Morse (1971) biofacies model for anoxic and hypoxic habitats pro­ posed by Thompson et al. (1985). Basically, it differs from the model of Rhoads & Morse (1971) by lowering the upper limit of oxygen from l.D to O.3mlr I for the dysaerobic zone (Rhoads et al. 1991). The availability of large quantities of high quality organic matter results in an increased tolerance of species through energetic compensation. Even though more energy is used in surviving within the hypoxic environment, the availability of easily digested and nutritious organic maner allows populations of tolerant species to flourish.

Tolerance to hypoxia and HzS from experiments
Physiological experiments
The physiological response of marine organisms to hypoxia is a broad subject, to which several review and summary papers are devoted (see Mangum & van Winkle 1973, Herreid 1980, Warren 1984). Here we will summarize results from papers dealing with tolerance of marine infauna to hypoxia. In these experiments, unfortunately, few effons were made to treat the organisms as if they were in their naNral benthic babital. Consequently, the ecolog­ ical implications of these results are difficult to assess.
In a series of experiments conducted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, more than 20 ben­ iliic species were examined for tolerance to hypoxia andlor H,S (Theede et aI. 1969, von Oenzen & Schlungbaum 1972. Theede 1973, Dries & Theede 1974). The methods used in these experiments were similar. Most organisms were obtained from the south Baltic, but some came from the Nom Sea.. The experimentS were perfonned in glass cylinders with fil­ lered sea water and no sediment. The oxygen was lowered by bubbling nitrogen gas into the water. to which animals were added. Such procedures not only shock the organisms but also alter the pH and carbonate balance of lhe water. In addition, the absence of sediment means that organisms were tested wilhoul their natural environment.
At a salinity of 17psu and a temperature of 10cC survival of species in oxygen concencra· tions < 0.15mll- 1 varied beT:YIeen a few hours and three months (Dries & Theede 1974). The species with highest tolerances were arctic bivalves, followed by boreal bivalves. polychae· tes, echinoderms, and then crustaceans (Fig. 7). In another experiment, comparisons were made between lolerance to hypoxia alone (O.15mlr l) and to hypoxia plus H2S "in a concen-

[ralion approximately comparable 10 that of certain areas in the Nonh Sea. Baltie Sea and Black Sea" (Theede et a1. 1969, Theede 1973). These authors conclude that high resistance to HzS parallels that to hypoxia. Theede et al. (1969) found the tolerance in experiments with hypoxia at WOC to be approximately 20% higher compared with hypoxia plus H2S (Fig. 7). These experiments suggest that the addition of H2S had a minor but notable effect on the sur­ vival of benthic animals. In similar parallel experiments with five bivalves exposed to hypoxia (0.l-O.15mW ll and H2S (2_14mgr l), it was concluded that resistance of these spe­ cies to hypoxia was similar to resistance to H2S (von Denzen & Schlungbaum 1972). In other experiments dealing with physiological parameters. but using similar methods 10 those detailed above. Oeschger (1990) and Oeschger & Storey (1990) mention that the priapuJid Halicryptus spinulosus and the bivalves Astarte borealis and Arctica islandica can withstand anoxic conditions for long periods.
Llans6 (1991), found Streblaspio benedicti. which is at times dominant in hypoxic estua­ rine habitats of North America, tolerant of severe hypoxia (surviving at least 14 days at 0.4mW I
). However, its low tolerance of anoxia (100% mortality in 2.3 days, LT~ 1.8 days) was typical for that of other polychaete species (Table 2 in Uans6 1991). Tolerance of Stre­ blospio benedicti was not reduced by exposure to anoxia combined with 66p.M sulphide (L1ans6 1991). Two polychaetes particularly sensitive 10 sulphide under hypoxic conditions are Cirrifonnia tenJaculata. with survival reduced by five days in the presence of 200,uM sulphide (Beslwich et aI. 1989), and Arenicola marina. survival reduced from 10 to 4.5 days with IO,uM (Groenendaal1980).
The hypoxia tolerance of the polychaetes Capitella capitata and Polyphysia crassa was tested at 5_6°C. About 50% of these animals survived atO.8-0.9m11- 1 ofoxygen for 13 and 8 days. respectively. AI 1.5m.ll- 1 most Capitella capitara survived >24 days (Rosenberg 1972). Capitella sp. 1 stopped burrowing and feeding at <0.8mll- 1 when confronted with hypoxia. These behavioural changes may account for the relatively long survival times of adultS in severe hypoxia (2mm Hg) with no food or sediment (only 30% monality after 35 days, Warren 1977). However, at least trace amouots of oxygen are needed for long-term sur­ vival (100% monality after 30 days in < 1mmHg, Warren 1977). The net effect ofprolonged hypoxia on populalions may then be indirect through starVation induced monality and not from lack of oxygen. In hypoxia, small Capitella sp. I lose body volume at 3 %dol and large worms at 20%d- 1 (Forbes & Lopez 1990). It appears that in severe hypoxia small worms are better able to salisfy their metabolic demands with more efficient aerobic metabolism using the small amount ofavailable oxygen than are large worms (Forbes & Lopez 1990).
Lower temperatures were positively correlated with increased survival during hypoxia. With few exceptions. survival was longest at O°C followed by 5, 10, 15. and 20°C (von Oenzen & Schlungbaum 1972. Dries & Theede 1974). The influence of salinity was minimal for euryhaline species (Theede et al. 1969). Results from these authors also indicate that infauna inhabiting ftner sediments (clay-silt) seem to have a higher tolerance than infauna from sandy sedimen1S. Experiments repeated during different seasons suggest that if the indi­ viduals were tested at different points in their life histories, differem tolerance times may result. For example, Ophiura albida showed only half the tolerance time (LDso) to hypoxia in May to July compared with December to February (Dries & Theede 1974).
Larval tolerance of hypoxia in opponunistic species may be critical to their early recolo­ nization of hypoxia slressed habitats, particularly in organically enriched habitats which are prone to develop hypoxia and anoxia due to high chemical and biological oxygen demand. L1ans6 (991) found that larvae of Streblospio benedict; were unaffected when exposed to short-term hypoxia (92 h, 14% saturation). The response of Mytilus eduJis larvae 10 hypoxia

varies with developmental stage (Wang & Widdows 1991). Embryo and early prodissoconch larvae of M. edulis are tolerant of hypoxia and grow normally at oxygen concentrations as low as 1.0mn- 1• Growth of later stage larvae was depressed by hypoxia, but hypoxia had lit­ tle influence on settlement behaviour of pediveligers (Wang & Widdows 1991).
Experiments with sediments
When hypoxia is initiated at the sediment/water interface, H2S concentrations increase in the oxic sediments above the redox potential discontinuity (RPD) layer and may reach toxic con­ centrations for the infaWla. Toxicity of H2S results from the inhibition of the electron trans­ porr chain in aerobic respiration (Torrans & Clemens 1982). Vismann (1991a) has reviewed the literature on sulphide tolerance and states that increased tolerance may be achieved by five different mechanisms: prevention of H2S from entering the organism, possession of an H2S insensitive cytochrome.-e oxidase, reliance on anaerobic metabolism, detoxification of H2S by endosymbiotic sulphide-oxidizing bacteria, and detoxification of H2S in the animal tissue. Thus, to understand fully the effects of oxygen deficiency on infaunal organisms the concentration of H2S inust be laken into account. The additional stress caused by H2S is, as for hypoxia alone, dependent on concentration, temperature (von Oenzen & Schlungbaum. 1972) and duration of exposure. In this section we summarize experiments designed to sim­ ulate natural conditions, with animals tested within their native sediment.
Six infaunal species indicative of pollution in the Oresund, between Denmark and Swe­ den, were pU! in 1-1 jars with native sediment (Henriksson 1969). The jars were sealed and all oxygen was consumed in two to three days. Macorna balthica showed me highest resist­ ance, with 50% surviving after 18 days. The ranked tolerance in declining order of the other species was Cardium lamarcki -+ Nereis diversicolor -+ Seoloplos armiger -+ Ampharece grubei -+ Terebellides stroemi. Thus, it seems that bivalves (Macoma and Cardium) were more tolerant than polychaetes in this test with rapidly declining oxygen ending in anoxia.
Vismann (1990) exposed the po1ychaetes Nereis diversicolor and N. virens to hypoxia (c. 10% saturalion) and 10 hypo"ia combined with 172-181p.M sulphide continuously sup· plied to the water in a flow through system with natural sediment. No differences in survival were found between the treatments during the first six days, but subsequently N. virens in hypoxia+sulphide showed a higher monaiity, whereas the worms exposed to only hypo"ia survived for at least another five days; however, there was no replication. N. diversicolor survived both treatments during the initial 16 days, but during the following six days mortal­ ity was higher in hypoxia+sulphide. Such tolerance to hypoxia+sulphide corresponds 10 the sulphide tolerances determined by Miron & Kristensen (1993) and Theede et al. (1913) for both species. N. virens was the least tolerant of pore water sulphide with N. diversicolor and N. succinea possessing adaptive mechanisms to cope with sulphide. Such mechanisms were also described by Vismann (1990) and Oeschger & Janssen (1991). The presence of sulphide in moderate to high concentrations combined with hypoxia appears 10 be more toxic than hypoxia alone after prolonged exposure. The build·up of sulphide in the sediment during hypoxia may also reduce survival of infaunal species. Imabayashi (1986) indicated matjuve­ niles of The bivalve Theora lubrica appear more susceptible to hypoxia and hydrogen sul­ phide than do adults.
The tolerance of three terebellid polychaetes (Loimia medusa, Terebella lapidaria, and Terebellides scroenu) to anoxia and severe hypoxia is similar and ranges from three to six days (Henriksson 1969, Warren 1984, Llans6 & Diaz 1994). In moderate hypoxia (0.7ml1- 1,

14% saturalion) Loimia medusa survived at leasl 14 days (L1ans6 & Diaz 1994). In hypoxic experiments (4.7-6.2% saturation at about 100 e) with animals in Scm of sieved sediments, Larsen & Petersen (l991) found mat most individuals of Amphiurafiliformis, Abra alba, Abra nirida, and Mysel1£l bidenrara survived for at least 17 to 34 days.
Tolerance of benthic communities in their namral sediments with different redox poten­ tials, one "non-sulphidic" and the other "sulphidic" at the sediment surface, to moderate (about O.7m11- 1
) and severe hypoxia (about OAmll- l ) was tested. by Nilsson & Rosenberg
(1994) (Fig. 8). In the "non-sulphidic" community, survival of individuals was reduced in severe hypoxia compared with moderate hypoxia and normoxia. In me "sulphidic" commu­ nity abundance and the number of species were significantly reduced in the moderate and severe hypoxia compared with normoxia. Although the species composition was nOI the same in the two experiments the results suggest that higher H2S concentrations in the sedi­ ment intensify the effect of hypoxia.
Rosenberg et aL (l991) exposed eight infaunal species (Abra alba, A. nitida, Amphiura fiiiformis, A. chiajei, Arctica islandial, Cerasroderma roule, Mya arenaria and Ophiura alb­ ida) to gradually declining oxygen concentrations in their native sediment. Salinity and tem­ perature were constant during the experiments at 32psu and lO-lloC. Hypoxia (O.63m11- 1

the experiment. The majority of species tested survived for several days to several weeks in hypoxia. All differences between controls and treatments were significant with the exception of Arctica islandica trials. The lobster Homarus gammtlrus was tested in similar experiments but without sediment. After about 30 days. lobsters in hypoxia (I.6mll- l
) were sluggish, and all lobsters died on the 41st day when oxygen was 0.63m11- 1

Behavioural changes caused by hypoxia
Much of what we know about behavioural and physiological compensation to hypoxia in marine benthos is derived from intertidal species (see Warren 1984). Intertidal organisms are regularly subjected to hypoxia during low tide when they are isolated from the water column. The compensation mechanisms that have evolved are all directed towards short-term survival of hypoxia but also allow organisms to utilize habitats that experience periodic hypoxia or are permanently marginal relative 10 dissolved oxygen concentration.
While Mangum & van Winkle (I973) found that most species tested showed some com­ pensation for surviving in reduced oxygen conditions, there does not appear 10 be any long­ tenn physiological mechanism for surviving chronic stable hypoxia. In metazoans, the shift to anaerobic pathways during severe hypoxia and anoxia is energetically less efficient than aerobic pathways utilized during normoxia and consequently 100 costly to allow lhe comple· tion of a Iife-cycle (Herreid 1980, Powell 1989). An exception may be lhose upwelling areas and OMZs where chronic and stable hypoxia is associated with highly nutritious organic mat­ ter (Mullins et aI. 1985, Levin et al. 1991). Under these conditions, a low-oxygen-tolerant fauna may evolve and chrive (Tunnicliffe 1981, Rosenberg et aI. 1983). In che upweUing system off Peru, Rosenberg et aI. (1983) found six genera to be abundant and have high biomass in a permanenlly oxygen deficient area of the continental slope.
Fluctuating and short-term hypoxia is survivable through a combination of behavioural (Steimle &,Radosh 1979, J0rgensen 1980, Stachowitsch 1984) and physiological adaptations (Herreid 1980, Innes 1985). With the onset of hypoxia. the dynamic balance between oxygen concenlration and an organism's response shifts hierarchically (Table 4, p. 276). The first response to declining oxygen is an increase in respiration rate. Petersen & Petersen (1988) found that as oxygen concentration declined to 50-60% saturation a gobiid fish initiated increased respiration before avoidance behaviour. Mobile fauna then begin to migrate away from Jow-oxygen areas (Renaud 1986a,b. Pih11989, Badenetal. 199Oa, Rahel & Kolar 1990, Pihl et al. 1991). Fauna, unable to leave or escape, initiate a series of sublethal responses related to the severity of hypoxia (Warren 1984). Feeding ceases and activities not related to respiration decrease. Increased periods of rest occur to depress metabolism. Under anoxia rube irrigation decreases (Warren 1984). For infaunal species decreased rube irrigation has che eUect of allowing the accumulation of reduced compounds in sediments that were previously oxidized. As oxygen continues to decline and/or reduced compounds accumulate, the infauna migrate closer to the sediment surface (Ankar & Jansson 1973, J0rgensen 1980, Vismann 1990. Tyson & Pearson 1991b. Ltans6 1992). The moribund individuals lying on the surface of the sediment are thus easy prey if pelagic predators are able to enter the hypoxic water col­ umn to feed (Pihl et aI. 1992). Selective mortality occurs first among the more sensitive taxa, such as crustaceans and echinoderms (Harper et al. 1981, Stachowjtsch 1984, Boesch & Rab­ alais 1991). Ifhypoxia persists or intensifies, extensive monality is seen in all bUlthe mOSt tol­ erant species (Arntz 1981, Weigelt & Rumhor 1986, Rosenberg & Lao 1988. Ltans6 1992).
MARINE BENTHIC HYPOXIA
Many epifaunal and infaunal species react to declining oxygen concentrations with a similar set of behaviours (Table 4). Mobile species first attempt to avoid hypoxia through migration. Infaunal species capable of limited mobility may also attempt an escape response (Diaz et aL 1992). Hypoxia causes the RPD layer to migrate closer to the sedimem surface by reducing the oxygen gradient into the sediment. This forces tube dwelling and burrowing species to move closer to the sediment surface (Ankar & Jansson 1973, Rosenberg 1977) or to emerge from the sediment in search of higher oxygen concentrations (Egusa & Yamamoto 1961, J.0rgensen 1980). The process of emerging from the sediment into hypoxic bottom water appears to be regulated by the oxygen microgradients within centimetres of the bottom (Tyson & Pearson 1991b) and by accumulation ofH2S within the sediments (Vismann 1991). Once on the sed­ iment surface, different postures are assumed depending on lhe oxygen concentration.
Some bivalves react to hypoxia by stretching lheir siphons up into the water colunm, where more oxygen andlor some current may be found. In lhe Limfjord, Denmark, where a strong gradient in oxygen concentrations was found within lhe benthic boundary layer. with minimum values of0.1-0.7 mll- ' ,Mya arenaria, Cerascoderma edule andAbra alba were observed with their siphons extended into the waler column (Jmgensen 1980). Mya arenaria extended their siphons 20-30cm above the sea bed. In experiments at mean oxygen concentrations of 0.9mll- l , Rosenberg et aI. (1991) detennined that the water column siphon activity of Abra alba was 3.5 times greater than that of specimens in oxygenated waters. A. alba also had a sig­ nificantly higher siphon activity than A. nitida when exposed to hypoxia. MuUnia UlteraUs remained active and continued to feed when exposed to hypoxia (Shumway et aI. 1983). The amphipod Corophium volutaror responded to oxygen saturation below 30% by constructing mud tubes that protruded from the sediment surface. These tubes may then serve to raise the point of contact above the sediment surface into more oxygenated water (Eriksson & Weeks 1994).
Responses of white (Penaeus setiferus) and brown (P. aztecus) shrimp to hypoxic water encompass the range of possible behavioural reactions. These shrimp first increase their gen­ eral activity level (rapid eye-stalk movements and flexing of their antennal scales) and then retreat from hypoxia by walking or swimming. In addition, white shrimp unable to escape hypoxia exhibited abdominal flexures until they appeared exhausted (Renauld 1986b). White shrimp detected and avoided hypoxic water ~l.lmlrl. Brown shrimp were more sensitive and avoided hypoxic water :S:1.4rnll-1
. Physiological StreSS from hypoxia and resultant abnormal behaviours may make shrimp more vulnerable to predators that are more tolerant of low oxygen levels.
Rosenberg et al. (1991) demonstrated a threshold response to decreasing oxygen concen­ tration in the ophiuroids Amphiura filifonnis and A. chiajei (Fig. 9). Under normoxia these ophiuroids live in a buried position with their discs at about 5cm from the sediment surface. During hypoxia they move rapidly to the sediment surface. More than half of the A.filiformis emerged at a concentration ofO.85mll- 1, and at O.54mll- 1 for A. chiaje. Specimens on the sediment surface frequently stood on the tips of their anns with the disc elevated above the surface. They were also found lying upside-down. It was suggested that the significantly higher tolerance to hypoxia of A. chiajei was because this species has a respiration rate five times lower than A. filiformis (Buchanan 1964).
In growth experiments with juvenile A. filiformis and Abra alba in sediment. Larsen & Petersen (1991) found that at about 20 %saturation, growth was approximately the same as in fully oxygenated water. Growth was reduced by 44 % and 61 % for these species, respec­ tively, at 10% saturation. Forbes & Lopez (1990) found for Capitella sp. I that a reduction in oxygen from 5.4 to 1.5mll-1 decreased growth of large worms (> 1.6mgww individual)

by up to 36% per day. Continued reduction of oxygen from 1.6 to O.8mU- 1 further decreased growth of large worms from 2% to 25% per day. Growth of small worms (< I . Img WW), however, was unaffected.
During a hypoxic event in the Kanegat, OphiuTa albida were observed from a remotely operated submersible vehicle to be standing inunobile on their arm tips at an oxygen concen­ tration of0.5-O.6m11- 1 (7-10% saturation). In an adjacent bottom area, where the oxygen concentration was lAmll- 1 (24% saturation, 15Q C), the brittle Slars were mobile with their discs on the sediment surface (Baden et a1. 1990a). In the area where O. albida were on their arm tips, arms of what must have been Amphiura filifarmis were actively waving up in the water colutrUl. It is not clear on the video if the discs were at the sediment surface (Rosen­ berg, pers. obs.). During hypoxia in the North Sea, OphiuTa albida were also observed standing on their arm tips at an oxygen concentration ofO.6mlr I (14 Q C) (Dethlefsen & von Westernhagen 1983). These authors found that O. albida had the same arm tip posture in the laboratory at an oxygen concentration of 1.35m11- 1 • Thus, it seems that an oxygen concen­ tration less than about 1.4mn-1 can trigger this "arm-tipping" behaviour.
Sea cucumbers, when first confronted with hypoxia (60-70% saturation), swell 10
increase their surface area to volume ralio, which promOtes oxygen uptake through their gen­ eral body surface. The large coelom also provides a store of oxygen, which allows individ­ uals to initiate an escape from the hypoxia. When faced with severe hypoxia « 15torr) sea cucumbers will eviscerate to reduce their metabolic requirements (Asiall & Jones 1991).
When initially exposed to hypoxic conditions, the polychaete Loimia medusa ceased feed­ ing activities within 20h, but c<mtinued to irrigate their tubes. After 42-122h in 14.3% sal­ uration, feeding resumed. General activity of L. medusa (tube irrigation, protrusion of the anterior thoracic region out of the tube, movement of tentacles and branchia) declined during the 14-days exposure to hypoxia (14.3 and 7.2% saturation). About 25% of the worms came out of their rubes during the 14-days experiment (Llans6 & Diaz 1994). Under anoxic con­ ditions L. medusa rapidly ceased feeding and tube irrigation activities, and staned to evacu­ ate their tubes after 24h (L1ans6 & Diaz 1994).
Metridium senile can survive extended periods of anoxia. Wahl (1984) described a set of behaviours for M. senile in anoxia that stans with retraction of tentacles and reduction of
MA RINE BENTHIC HYPOXIA
body surface when anoxia is first encountered. After 7 to 9 days of exposure to anoxia, energy consuming activities ceased. At approximately 10 days of exposure the anemone detached from its subsrrarum. If oxygen levels increase before both ciliary activity stops and detachment occurs, 60% of the anemones recover.
In experiments with natural sediments, many infaunal species leave the sediment at oxygen concentrations below O.7mll- 1 (12% saturation). After several days at that concen­ tration, the polychaete Pecrinaria koreni emerged from the sediment with its tube. Later the lUbe fell over and the worm died. The echinoderms Echinocardium cordatum and Amphiura fllifonnis, and the small bivalve Mysella bidentata migrated to the sediment surface (Nilsson & Rosenberg 1994). Also, Ockelmann & Muus (1978) observed M. bidenlata emerging from the sediment at 5% saruration, while at 8-10% saturation it again dug into the sediment
In November 1977, a severe hypoxic event in the northern pan of the Adriatic caused mass mortality of benthos. Divef5 found millions of dead shells as well as lobsters outside their dens and grouped on the highest parts of outcrops (Stefanon & Boldrin 1981). Stacho­ witsch (1984, 1991) provides a detailed and illustrative description of benthic infaunal and epifaunal behaviour during the September 1983 hypoxic event in the Adriatic. However, no oxygen recordings were made. Infauna emerged from the sediment and aggregated on the slightest bottom relief forming mounds of animals. This aggregation pattern was performed by Amphiura chiajei and Asrropecten bispinosus. Amphiura chiajei and Ophiura texturala were also observed standing on their arm tips, and Astropeclen bispinosus and OphiOlhrix quinquemaculata were positioned upside-down on the sediment surface. During the period of observation the surface sediments became darker in colour, excepl on top of the mounds. This suggests that the oxygen cOI'.centration was higher a few cenlimetres above the flat sea bed. ThrOUgh this behaviour the organisms were auempting to raise themselves above the hypoxic layer including the millimetre thin diffuse boundary layer where declining gradients of oxygen are steepest (Gundersen & J£lrgensen 1990).
In the eastern Hiuchi-Nada and Bisan Strait, Seto Inland Sea, Japan, late summer (AuguSI 1983) thermal stratification initiates moderate hypoxia (1.6m11- 1, 33% saturation) over deep (> 20m) muddy habitats (Irnabayashi 1986). In these habitats hypoxia appears to be regulat­ ing the settlement and survival of the deposit feeding bivalve Theora lubrica. T. lubrica pro­ duces planktonic larvae throughout the year, with continuous recruitment into both normoxic and hypoxic habitats. Survival of recruits in the periodic hypoxic habitats is low during hypoxia and high during normoxia. Those individuals that recruit during normoxia in the periodic hypoxic habitats grow rapidly, but only a few of the larger individuals survive the hypoxia.
Demersal trawling in hypoxic areas has shown that large numbers of infaunal species in areas of high abundance and biomass leave their protected positions in the sediment and lie exposed on the bonom. At a bottom water oxygen concentration of about lroll- l (15% saturation) in the Kattegat almost no fishes were caught, but 200-400kgh- 1 of benthic inver­ tebrates (echinoderms: Brissopsis lyrifera, Echinocardium cordarum, Cuctlmaria elongata, Ophiura spp., Amphiura flii/onnis, polychaetes: Polyphysia crassa, Aphrodite actlleata, /lfephrys spp.) were collected (Baden et al. 199Oa). Similar mass migration of benthic infauna 10 the sediment surface was recorded during nawling in the North Sea (Dyer et al. 1983). Many species were the same as in the Kanegat, but no oxygen recordings were made during trawling. Low values (about 2mB- I ) were, however, recorded in the area about that time. Also, during the 1976 aperiodic hypoxic event on the middle Atlantic continental slope off New Jersey large quantities of infauna were collected with trawls. Many of the infaunal spe­ cies in the trawls were deep dwelling and rarely laken in grab samples (Boesch & Rosenberg

1981). Similar observations were made by Taylor et al. (l985) off the nonheast coast of New Zealand during a summer hypo)(ic/anoxic event.
The Norway lobster, NephTops norvegicus, left lheir burrows in laboratory experiments at < 25% saturation (Hagerman & Uglow 1985). At 20% saturation they extended their legs (tiptoeing) 10 Sland higher above the sediment, and stopped feeding (Baden et al. 1990a.b). These authors have also shown mat catches of Norway lobsters increased during me moder­ ate hypoxic events of 1981 in lhe Kattegat, indicating that the emergence from burrows may occur in nature. Also, lhey found that the ratio offemales to males increased from 0.07-0.38 in moderate hypoxia to 0.74....(l.77 in severe hypoxia « 1mll- l , < 15% saturation). Other large crustaceans, the mantis shrimp (Squilla empusa) and the blue crab (Caflinecres sap­ idus), have been shown to migrate from deeper hypoxic to shallower nonnoxic areas in Chesapeake Bay (Pih.1 et al. 1991). The so called "jubilees" of Mobile Bay, Alabama, which have occurred for many years, are mass migrations of fauna, from deeper to shallower water, attempting to avoid encroaching hypoxia (Loesch 1960, May 1973). Such avoidance reactions were not observed for lhe shrimp Crangon crangon or lhe shore crab Carcinus maenas in the Limfjord. These species eventually died from exposure to hypoxia (Je:rgensen 1980).
The polychaetes Nereis diversicolor and N. virens left the sediment in higher numbers in hypoxia (10% saturation) + sulphide (172-187~M) than in experiments with only hypoxia. After 10 days in these experiments 35% of the number of N. diversicolor and 100% of N. virens had left the sediment in the combined treatments, whereas the numbers in hypoxia alone were 8 % and 17%, respectively (Vismann 1990). The difference in behaviour was sug­ gested by Vismann to be a consequence of N. diversicolor having a significantly higher sul­ phide oxidation activiry than N. virens. These experiments indicate that the addition of sulphide to the water causes a stronger behavioural reaction than hypoxia alone.
Sulphide can also act as a larval settlement cue. Larvae of Capitella sp. 1 was attracted by sulphidic sediment and enhanced the settlement during such circumstances (Cuomo 1985). In thai experiment a sulphide concentration ranging between 0.1 mm and I.Omm gave higher settlements and SUbsequent metamorphosis and survival of settled polychaetes compared with non-sulphidic controls.
The polychaete, Malacoceros juliginosus. was observed in experiments to change its behaviour in declining oxygen concentrations. Under fuJly oxic conditions this species lives below the sediment surface in burrows. When oxygen concentrations drop below 2.4m1I- I
,
they emerge from their burrows and rise partly up in the water column. When oxygen concentrations fall below 0.5mll- 1 M. juliginosus "begin undulatory body movements and ultimately fonn rapidly weaving clumps of animals" (Tyson & Pearson 1991b). These authors suggest lhis behaviour causes water from higher up in the boundary layer (presuma~
bly with higher oxygen content) 10 come in contact with the worms. The crab Munida quadrispirw. had a size distribution negatively correlated with the vertical
oxygen gradient in Saanich Inlet, British Columbia (Burd 1985). M. quadrispina was tolerant of hypoxia as low as 0.1 mlr I; however, only the largest crabs were found in the (owest oxy­ gen. In other British Columbia fjords that do not experience severe hypoxia no size gradients were seen. This population response to hypoxia appears to be caused by a size-dependent res­ piration tolerance. The minimum critical oxygen concentration below which the rate of oxy­ gen consumption declined in M. quadrispina is 0.14mU"' and corresponded with the lowest oxygen levels (0.1-0.15mll- l
) at which crabs were found in Saanich Inlet (Burd 1985). Intraspecific aggression of M. quadrispino. observed in normoxia was not seen in hypoxia, where lhe animals were often sitting on top ofeach other (Burd & Brinkhursl 1984).
MARINE BENTHIC HYPOXIA
Behavioural responses to predation are known to have a major influence on the distribu4
tion and activity of organisms. Relative to predation, however, behaviour appropriate for surviving or avoiding hypoxia is often inappropriate for avoiding predation. The distribution of nymphs of the mayfly Colliba~lis montanus was influenced by both hypoxia and presence of predators. C. montanus endure lower oxygen concentrations when exposed to flSh preda­ tors relative to conditions when fISh were absent (Rabel & Kolar 1990). Complex inter­ actions between competing species and how oxygen concentration affects these interactions needs further investigation.
A recent experimental study of such interactions with the predatory isopod Soduria ~nlomon in the Baltic gave the following results. Predation on the amphipods Corophium "olUla/or and 8aJhyporeia pi/osa declined significantly in low oxygen saturations of 17% (compared to 95, 50 and 30,.. saturation) and 351J1 saturation (compared to 95 and 50% saturation), respectively (Sandberg 1994). "These results suggest the existence of oxygen threshold saturations. where the predation efficiency of Saduria enIomon declines depending on the behaviour of prey species.
With the intensification or persistence of hypoxia there is a metabolic switching in favour of near anaerobic or anaerobic path ways. During anoxia most polychaetes have some abiliry for facultative anaerobiosis (Warren 1984). As anaerobic conditions approaCh the sediment swface. with a shallowing of the RPO (Jsrgensen 1980, Rhoads & GeI1IlaDO 1986). sulphur and anaerobic microbes experience population explosions (Rosenberg &. Diaz 1993, Grant C1 al.1995). This funher reduces the qualiry of the habitat for most metazoans (Stachowitseh 1984, 1986. Uans6 1992). With continued hypoxia. anoxic coooitions and H2S eventually reach the sediment surface and extend into the water column (Harper et aI. 1991, Rabalais et aI. 1991).
Once hypoxia is well developed, the magnirode of effects on infaunal community struC­ ture and energy flow are related to complex interactions ofa series of biological and physical parameters. The most imponaot of these seems to be the interaction of the duration of hypoxia and temperature. As temperature increases, the severity of hypoxia tends to increase while tolerance of hypoxia decreases. In effect this accelerates faunal change even if hypoxia decreases in duration. The successional stage of the community has an important bearing on how noticeable community changes will be and how much energy is shunted into microbial pathways.
Recovery processes
Recovery of benthic communities following hypoxic events depends primarily on the interaction between the severiry and longevity of the hypoxia with the compleJtiry of the com­ munity affected. The resilience of communities to hypoJtia is dependent on the constituent spedes, which have different life-cycles, reproduction periods and patterns of larval disper­ sal (Boesch & Rosenberg 1981). The severiry and longeviry of the bypoxia are dependent on hydrodynamic and mixing processes. When hypoxia has reduced or eliminated benthos. ini4
tial recovery follows the Pearson & Rosenberg (1978) enrichment-disrurbance model. Often habitats that experience hypoxia are affected by eutrophication driven processes, since the decay of organic matter is a primary factor in the initiation of hypoxia. In general, sediments enriched in organic matter have shallow RPO's. indicative of poor oxygen conditions within

me sediments (Jargensen & Revsbech 1985, Revsbech & Jorgensen 1986). Hypoxia and eutrophication are often highly correlated events. One of me best examples
of benthic recovery following the rerum to normoxic conditions can be found in the Saltkallefjord, Sweden. For decades the Saltkallefjord was a highly enriched fjordic sys[em (Rosenberg 1976 and references lherein). Following abatement ofenrichment, azoic bottoms at 20-40m deplh were initially recolonized by opponunists, which were followed by transi­ tional species and the process culminated in a "marore~ community. The entire recovery sequence took five to eight years. SUch benlhic recovery processes were later generalized by Pearson & Rosenberg (1978). One reason for lhe prolonged recovery time was suggested to be the long-tenn accumulation of organic material in the sediment, which had to be oxidized prior to the colonization of the 10ng~lived equilibrium type species.
Recovery of "mature" equilibrium dominants eliminated by hypoxia appears to be a proc­ ess requiring more than two years. In the Gullmarsfjord, the 1980/81 hypoxia, which was as low as O.2mll~I, eliminated all macrobenthic fauna below 115m. The recovery sequence was slow and communities were not re~established one-and-a~half years after the collapse (Josefson & Widbom 1988). Nematode populations affected at the same site were restored to pre-hypoxia levels one year later (Austen & Widbom 1991). At a station below the halocline in me Kauegat, where many species died during hypoxia in 1988, little to no recovery was observed in the following two years (Table 3). If a system begins to experience seasonal hypoxia, then equilibrium communities are likely be eliminated.
Recovery of epifaunal communities in the northern Adriatic was slow after the 1983 hypoxia. In the three years following Ibis event, Stachowitscb (1991) estimated that 15, 49, and 36 % of the initial biomass had returned. These first phases of recolonization were not by the same species that characterized the earlier community.
On the inner continental shelf off New Jersey the benthic commWlities at 25m experi~
enced a hypoxia-related mass monality following an unusual combination of events. An intense phytoplankton bloom during the summer of 1976, calm winds, and current reversals combined to cause an extensive pool of severe hypoxic and anoxic water (SOOOkm2) for about two months (Falkowski et al. 1980). Populations of GoniadelJa gracilis audAstarte castanea survived the hypoxia, and appeared unaffected. After this hypoxic stress, the affected area was rapidly recolonized by species with pelagic larvae. Some of these were previous com­ munity dominants (Eehinaraehnius panna, Spisula so/idissima) that, together with other taxa (Spiophanes bombyx. ampharetid polychaetes), established themselves opportunistically. After one year the opportunists declined in abundance, but many previously dominant spe­ cies had still not returned (Boesch & Rosenberg 1981). It was suggested by Boesch & Rosen­ berg (1981) that several years will be required for recovery of pre-hypoxia communities. On the inshore edge of this hypox.ic water mass, however, benthic effects were not as severe. Monality of Eehinaraehnius parnuJ populations was about 90%, while Spisula solidissiltUl and polychaetes experienced low monality « 10%). Mobile species were able to avoid the hypoxia (Garlo et al. 1979).
In the Bomholm basin of Ibe Baltic, recolonization occurs after aperiodically hypoxic bottom water is reox.ygenated. However, recovery to "mature" commWlities characteristic of the pre-hypoxic conditions does not seem to happen, as abundance and biomass are low. Leppakoski (1971) describes the polychaete Seoloplos armiger as one of the strong coloniz­ ers of the area, and states that the recolonizing community was not similar to me original community. The ability of S. armiger to colonize hypoxia stressed habitats quickly may be related to its abiliry to maintain fully aerobic metabolism at ox.ygen concentrations near O.8mll-1 and panial aerobic metabolism at SO.4mWI (Schottler & Grieshaber 1988).
MARINE BENTHIC HYPOXIA
In Kiel Bay, southwest Baltic, Arntz (1981) found recolonization to be rapid after a return of nonnoxic conditions from hypoxia. Initial rapid colonizers (Abra alba, Harmorhoe sarsi, Pecrinaria koreni, Halicryprus spinulosus. and Diasrylis rarMe!) were fast-growing and highly fecund organisms. From the same area experiencing mass-mortality in 1981, coloni­ zation rapidly restored the fonner community structure (Weigelt 1987).
From 1984 to 1987 hypoxia did nm occur in the German Bight. or was very short lived, and there was a rapid recovery of benthic communities following the 1981-8 severe hypoxic events. By 1986, community structure and biomass had recovered to pre-hypoxia levels (Niermann et aI. 1990). The rapid recovery can be attribUled to two basic factors; commu­ nities in these shallow water habitats are adapted to physically stressful envirorunental con­ ditions. and a strong recruitment pulse occurred shortly after the hypoxic event.
In shallow water, colonization of post hypoxic habitats is rapid and appears to be consist­ ently dominated by opportunistic species. In Tomoe Cove. Japan, the opportunist Capitella capirara rapidly colonized areas disturbed by hypoxia in high abundance following reoxy­ genation (Tsutsumi 1987). Similar rapid recolonization by opportunists occurred following annual summer anoxia in the subtropical Hillsborough Bay, Florida (Streblospio benedicti, Paraprionospio pinnata, POlydora ligni, Gyptis vinara. and Mulinia laleralis; Santos & Simon 1980) and Tolo Harbor, Hong Kong (Wu 1982). The rapid recolonization occurred through a combination of adult migration and larval recruitment. In Hillsborough Bay the timing of the stress-response was stable from one year to the next with only the magnitude of recruitment varying from year to year (Santos & Bloom 1980).
In the shallow macrotidal Bay of Somme. France, hypoxia and anoxia first became appar­ ent in 1982 with the mass mortality of benthic populations and collapse of the cockle fIShery (Desprez et aL 1992). Anoxia-associated mass mortalities were recorded in subsequent years (1983, 1985, 1989) and were attributed to phytoplankton blooms fuelled by nutrients derived from river and land runoff. The 1982 hypoxia and subsequent anoxia developed after the coincidence of high summer temperatures (2°C above average) with high river flows (50% above average). Cockle, CerastodermtJ edule, populations did not recover from this series of events until 1987 and the fishery did not recover until 1988. Two years after the severe anoxia in 1982. the opponunist Pygospio elegans dominated the benthos. but declined in numbers with the return of the cockle. In addition to changing the composition of the benthos, anoxia-induced mortality of the cockle caused its principal predators, the oyster­ catcher (HaemaJopus osrralegus) and the common gull (LaTUS canus), to switch prey. Popu­ lation fluctuations of these birds, however, could nOI be related to cockle mortalities as a result of this opportunistic feeding strategy.
Ecosystem energy-now implications
Elmgren (1984), in an energy·f}ow model of the Baltic, described the dominance of zoo­ plankton as consumers and ascribed a comparatively minor role to the benthic fauna. Below about 70m the benthic fauna has been impoverished since the great drop in oxygen levels in the 1960s, but on the other hand the benthic biomass shallower than 70m has increased (Ced­ erwall & Elmgren 1980). Whether this increase in shallow water biomass compensates for the losses in deeper waters is not known. Large areas of hypoxic bonoms in the Baltic are proba­ bly inhabited by sulphur bacteria (BeggiarOQ spp.) (Rumohr 1990, Rosenberg & Diaz 1993).
In separate models for the soulilwest Baltic, Arntz (1978. 1981) has shown how the ben-

thic system changes in relation to episodic hypoxia. Depending on the severity and duration of hypoxia and presence of H2S, a completely different size structure of macrobenthos occurs in different years. This in rum will affecl demersal ftsh populations.
An energy-flow model outlined for the southeast Kanegat showed that the benthic fauna (suspension feeders) played a major role in energy transfer (Pearson & Rosenberg 1992). BelowaboUl 13m, however. the benthic faunal companmem was affccled by interminent hypoxia. Consumption of large crustaceans. shrimps and crabs. was only 23% in this zone compared with shallower water. As was described earlier. the Norway lobster was elimi­ nated from this area in [he late 1980s. The Pearson & Rosenberg (1992) model showed mat during prolonged severe hypoxia or anoxia. energy flow through the macrobenthic compart­ ments would be reduced and finally cease. This could result in enhanced accumulalion of organic carbon. whic!) could lead to development of sulphur bacterial mats and increased prominence of anaerobic pathways. Williams & Reimers (1983) found that bacterial mats are common in coastal upwelling OMZS and that they are an important source of organic matter. Gallardo (1977) recorded bacterial mats with biomass as high as lOOOgwwm-2 at 60m off the Chilean coast. Rosenberg & Diaz (1993) found similar mats existing in hypoxic habitats of the inner Stockholm archipelago. Thus, in areas dominated by bacterial mats. a large por­ tion of the organic input is remineralized and utilized by prokaryotic organisms. This in effect weakens benthic-pelagic coupting. and tends to shorten the food chain (Baird & Ulanowic21989).
The Kauegat ecosystem seems to be vulnerable to severe hypoxia, which shifts energy from macrobenthic compartments and the commercially important Norway lobster to benthic microbes. The importance of chemoautotrophic bacteria in the energy flow of hypoldc hab­ itals was also seen in the panly anoldc Byfjord, Sweden (Rosenberg et al. 1977). In the nor­ moxie water above the halocline a great proportion of me energy was channelled through the suspension feeding macrobenthic compartment, as was seen in the Kattegal, but below the halocline bacteria dominated the energy flow.
Meta-analysis ofglobal hypoxic events
We found approximalely 40 syslems around the world that ellpericnce oxygen sEtess and have bemhic community response and recovery dala (Table 1). There are still many omer syslems mat report oxygen problems, such as New Zealand (Taylor et aI. 1985) or Long Island Sound, New York (Welsh & Eller 1991), bUI conditions within me benthos relative to response and recovery are not documented. To evaluate the material in Table I. each of the systems was trealed as a replicate and cross-classified by type. level, and temporal trends of hypoxia. bemhic community response and recovery, and fisheries response. Table 1 is a con· temporary summary of hypoxic conditions and effects around lhe world. We suspect that sig· nificam changes have already occurred or will occur in the near future within these systems.
The impression that most systems experience seasonal or persistent hypoxia is due to the attemion given to the recurrence of hypoxic events. A number of these systems. however, were nO! historically known to experience hypoxia, Le. Kiel Bay, the Gulf of Triesle, the Kanegal, or the Ballic Sea. Others have long histories of hypoxia, i.e. Chesapeake Bay or most of the fjordic and OMZ syStems.
When hypoxia does occur it tends to be severe «O.5mll- I ). Few systems experience
only moderate hypoxia, between 2 to 0.5mll- 1 , such as most years in the Kanegat and the
York River, Virginia. Only mild hypoxia is reported from the deeper Texas shelf and the
MARINE BENTHIC HYPOXIA
Seto Island Sea, Japan, but this may be due to sparse temporal or spatial coverage of oxygen measurements or through failure to measure oxygen close to the bottom. In both these systems, hypoxia-related mortality is reported.
Mortality, in particular mass mortality (virtual elimination of the fauna), is the most frequent responses of benthic communities to aperiodic and seasonal hypoxia. In the case of ecosystems experiencing aperiodic hypoxia. the mortality eliminates established and usually well developed communities. For persistent and seasonally hypoxic ecosystems. the mortal­ ity primarily occurs as premature death of recent recruits. Only about a third of the persist. ently hypoxic systems experience mortality. The other two thirds experience a stable but reduced benthic community structure. The only system where some form of community change to hypoxia has not been reported is the York River, Virginia, where periodic moder­ ate to severe hypoxia occurs. This is linked 10 the preconditioning of the benthos by years of hypoxic stress, as discussed earlier.
In about 50 %of all hypoxia-stressed systems, benthic recovery is annual; that is, commu­ nity structure at least returns to the previous year's level of organization. Of these, about 80 % experience seasonal hypoxia_ A low recovery rate is seen in about 30% of the systems and 20% show little or no signs of community change through time. Systems with low recov­ ery rates are about evenly split between aperiodic, seasonal and persistent hypoxia. All of the systems that show little change in community structure experience persistent hypoxia, except the York River. as explained above.
Benthic fisheries stocks are often adversely affected by hypoxia, resulting from migration of fish and mobile invertebrate species out of hypoxic areas and mortality of sessile species. All aperiodic hypoxic events appear to involve at least short-term reduction in commercial catches or high mortality of sessile species. Seasonal severe hypoxia accounts for reductions in the Norway lobster in the Kattegat and the reduction of commercial catches in fjordic systems. Persistently hypoxic systems have no bottom fIsheries.
Discussion and conclusions
Higher taxa and. individual responses
Most species of the marine macrobenthic infauna belong to the taxonomic groups poly­ chaetes, molluscs, echinoderms and crustaceans. From the summarized literature, it is appar­ ent that thcsc groups cliliibit different lcvels of lolcrancc to hypoxia. Studies in coastal areas in Scandinavia (Rosenberg 1977, Gray et al. 1988), the Adriatic (Stachowitsch 1992), Japan (Tsutsumi 1987), USA (Llans6 1992, Harper et al. 1991), the Black Sea (Bacesco 1963), and in offshore upwelling areas off Peru (Rosenberg et al. 1983, Levin et al. 1991) and California (Mullins et al. 1985) show that in general, polychaetes are the moSt lolerant taxa, followed by bivalves. Crustaceans are less tolerant than bivalves (Stickle et al. 1989). The same general grouping of taxa relaled tolerance was recorded in experiments with "natural" benthic com· munities (Nilsson & Rosenberg 1994). Some species are found repeatedly in hypoxic-stressed areas (Table 2) such as the polychaetes Heteromastusfilifonnis. Srreblospio benedicti, Par· aprionospio pinnata and the bivalves Corbula gibba and Arc/ica islandica, but echinoderms and crustaceans are rarely described from such areas. From experiments it is known, how­ ever. that exceptions exist, for example the isopod Saduria entomon can survive in hypoxic water for very long periods (Hagennan & Szaniawska 1988).
283
ROBERT J. DIAZ & RUTGER ROSENBERG
In lhe brackish southwest Baltic, several bivalves (e.g. Astarte borealis) are mentioned as the most resistant species to extended hypoxic periods along with some polychaetes (Lep­ pakoski 1969). This was also found in experimental work with species from the same area, where Theede (1973) and Dries & Theede (1974) found bivalves to be the most tolerant group followed by polychaetes, echinoderms and crustaceans. The priapulid Halicryptus SpiTUllosus was also recorded among the more tolerant species. Other taxonomic groups that have panicularly tolerant species to hypoxia are anemones (Ceriaruhus sp., Epiz.oan.thus erinaceus) in me Adriatic (Stachowitsch 1992) and in Danish fjords (Jergensen 1980), and phoronids in Swedish fjords (Rosenberg 1977).
Even though some general relations are found between taxa and tolerance to hypoxia, a detailed examination of some genera demonstrate signifICant differences. The significantly higher tolerance to hypoxia in the presence of sulphide shown by the polychaete Nereis diver· sicolor compared with N. virens was related to higher sulphide oxidation activity in the blood in N. diversicolor, which bad an impact on the distribution of these species (VisrnanD 1990). In another experiment without sediment it was shown that N. diversicolor had the highesttol­ erance to hypoxia followed by N. virens and N. sucdllea and fmally N. pelagica (Theede et aI. 1973). During successively lowered oxygen concentrations the brittle star Amphiurafili­ formis left their sedentary position and appeared at the sediment surface before A. chiajei (Rosenberg et aL 1991). The higher tolerance shown by A. chiajei was attributed to the lower respiration rate shown by this species compared to A. fili/ormis. In similar experimen[S the bivalve Abra alba was more active (number of siphons stretched out of the sediment) com­ pared with A. Ilitida (Rosenberg et al. 1991). Thus, species of the same genera can show dif­ ferent mortality rates and behaviour in the same hypoxic concentration.
Subsurface-feeding fauna penetrate to various dep1hs within lhe sediment and should be expected to be tolerant of low oxygen concentrations and perhaps also to rather high concen­ trations of H2S. However, there is no indication that any specific infaunal functional group­ ing is more or less tolerant of hypoxia and its related effcc[S. Even though some subsurface feeders (e.g. Heteromastus filiformis) are found in hypoxic environmen[S, surface deposit feeders (Parapriollospio pinnara), filter feeders (Aslarte borealis, Corbula gibba and Arctica islandica), predators (Ophiodromus flexuosus and Halicryprus spinulosus) and anthozoans (Epiz.OQmhus erinaceus) are also commonly found in hypoxia. Some of the species or faunal groups mentioned above are mobile, while some are mainly stationary or even sessile. Thus, there is no clear evidence that the position in the sediment occupied by infaunai species, their motility, or their feeding mode or trophic level is related to meir tolerance to hypoxia.
As another example supporting this conclusion, the decapod Nephrops Ilorvegicus, inhab­ iting deep burrows in the sediment, resists oxygen saturation of 12% for a few days only (Baden et al. 1990b). Another decapod, Homarus gammarus, living in rock crevices where oxygen concentrations ought to be high can tolerate oxygen concentrations in the range of O.5-1.0mll· 1 (8-15% saturation) for several weeks (Rosenberg et a1. 1991). Thus, the latter species, presumably poorly adapted to hypoxia, is slightly more tolerant to hypoxia than N. norvegicus, which should experience seasonally lowered oxygen concentrations in its pre­ ferred habitat: deep muddy bottoms.
We have found three studies in panicular where the tolerance of meiofauna and macro­ fauna to hypoxia are compared in the same area. In lhe Gullmarsfjord, Sweden, declining oxygen concentrations had a greater impact on the macrofauna compared with the meiofauna (JosefSOD & Widbom 1988). In the Baltic, Elmgren (1975) found that meiofauna extends deeper into the hypoxic zone than the macrofauna. In deep, permanently hypoxic waters in the Pacific, associated with an OMZ, Levin et al. (1991) found that microbial and meiofaunal
MARINE BENTHIC HVPOXIA
communities are more tolerant than macro- and megafaunal communities. Nematodes are generally the mosl tolerant group in the meiofauna whereas harpacticoids are much more sensitive to hypoxia. Thus, we suggest that this tolerance is to some extent related to taxo­ nomic group and not to size only.
Hypoxia and community structure
The initial development of benthic hypoxia is through a combination of water column proc­ esses that involves isolation of a water mass from mixing and subsequent lowering of dissolved oxygen concentration. In estuarine and shallow coastal waters, physical forces stratify the water column, isolating the bottom water from mixing with oxygen rich surface waters. Once hypoxia is established, benthic processes respond in a synergistic way to accel­ erated declining oxygen levels that is dependent upon a combination of factors including tem­ perature, and the quantity and quality of organic maner. Sedimentary biological and chemical oxygen demand cause the RPD to become shallower. As the RPD approaches the sediment sur­ face reduced compounds are mobilized into the water column. The principal reduced com­ pound lhat further messes the fauna is H25. Hypoxia and anoxia may also enhance the recycling of nutrients from the sediments, which supports increased primary production which leads to increased water column and bonom oxygen demand.
Benthic habitats experiencing recurring hypoxia share a common set of features that are related to the interaction ofoxygen dynamics and faunal response. Oxygen availability influ­ ences community structure and function by directly affecting metabolic processes and by indirectly affecting water column processes. Seasonal hypoxia is predominantly a sum­ mer-autumnal phenomena, so the elimination or suppression of macrobenthic activity during periods when biological activity should be peaking leads 10 an increase in organic matter in surface sediments and to an increased importance of microbes in energy cycling and carbon remineralization. Anaerobic metabolism is less efficient than aerobic pathways and does not utilize deposited organic maner as quickly. During hypoxic events the energy, from dead macrofauna and newly deposited organic matter, is sequestered by microfauna. This transfer of benthic energy to microbes still favours recolonization by macrobenthos if the duration of the hypoxia is short. As hypoxic events become longer and more intense, a larger proportion of the organic carbon will be remineralized by the microbes and less energy will be available to support benthic recruitment with the return of normoxic conditions.
Hypoxia is a major factor in the structuring of benthic communities and their function. The degree o'r tolerance to hypoxia and anoxia by species is of critkal imponance, panicu~ larly for maintenance of local deep-water populations which tend to experience prolonged summer-autumn hypoxia. The elimination of a functionally important species from these communities could have significant effects on geochemical and biologicaJ processes (Rosen~
berg & Diaz 1993. Llans6 & Diaz 1994). Many times oxygen gradients are paralleled by organic gradients (Pearson & Rosenberg 1978) and when hypoxia has reduced or eliminated benthos, initial recovery typically follows the Pearson-Rosenberg enrichment-disturbance model. When exposed to long·term or severe hypoxia, macrofaunal communities experience mass mortality. Temporal variability of communities increases and energy flow through the community becomes more pulsed. Large individuals and long~lived equilibrium species are eliminated, and populations shifted toward younger individuals, and smaJler and more short­ lived species that possess opportunistic life histories.
The effects of seasonal hypoxia on benthic community S(fUcture are consistent between
285

ecosystems, and depend On the frequency and severity of the hypoxia. A conceprual model of how hypoxia and community successional stage or complexity oforganization interact is pre­ sented in Figure 10. Prior to hypoxic stress, communities underwent natural cycles of annual variation. In systems that begin to experience aperiodic hypoxia, coaununities are not condi­ tioned to low oxygen, so mortality of individuals and elimination of species is significant, particularly at advanced successional stages. Annual variation within advanced stage com­ munities increases significantly. While lower successional stage communities may experi­ ence some variance increase, the increase cannot be detected from the backgroWld of their high natural variability. Aperiodic hypoxic events are precursors to the development of hypoxia-resistant communities. Increased energetic costs of population maintenance Wlder low oxygen stress eliminates sensitive species. By the time a system experiences periodic or seasonal hypoxia, communities have undergone most of their struCNrai and organizational changes. .
Communities found in systems that experience periodic hypoxia, consisting of repeated brief periods of days to weeks, are already stress-preconditioned, and show little change during or shortly after hypoxic events. With seasonal hypoxia, lasting for the order of months, despite the fact that communities are preconditioned, mass mortality often occurs with almost complete elimination of macrofaWla in communities at all stages of organization. Variance of community parameters again increases significantly. Systems with persistent hypoxia are occupied only by early successional stage communities. Diversity, abundance,

and biomass of I:hese communities decrease along stable gradients of increasing hypoxia to the poim of stable persisteD! anoxia, which is characterized by the absence of macrofauna. Partial exceptions to this type of community decline are OMZS that contact the bottom. OMZS tend to have stable hypoxia, and are frequently associated with the production of large quan­ tities of high quality organic matter that has allowed the development of a low diversity but stable fauna with high abundance and biomass.
Long-term or persistent severe hypoxia or anoxia induces retarded growth and poor reproductive success, resulting in failures in recolonization and in habitats that are devoid of macrofauna or possibly of all metazoan life. Exceptions to this are OMZS and highly eutrophic areas where large quantities of labile organic maner are available. This combina­ tion of hypoxia and organic maner creates a unique edge habitat in estuarine and marine hab­ itats that supports a low diversity, high energy flux community.
No macrofauna occur in persistem anoxic environments. For severe hypoxia/anoxia there appear to be no long-tenn mechanisms for survival. While some species (such as Halicryptus spinu/osus and Metridium senile) appear to exhibit long·term tolerance of anoxia, they do not survive to complete their life-cycles in severe hypoxic/anoxic environments. Intennediate­ tenn adaptations do exist for survival of seasonal hypoxic events, but few macrofaunal spe­ cies, except those menl:ioned above, possess them. Many macrobenthic species, however, possess behavioural and physiological mechanisms that allow survival of short-term aperi­ odic and periodic hypoxia (Table 4).
A key feature for the identification of hypoxia-related mortality is a shift in the timing of major populalion declines. Within most pulsed systems, increases in populations are related to recruitmem events timed to take advantage of the inpUt of new organic material. Mortal­ ity, even when rapid, can be related to a lack of resources or predation. Hypoxia shifts the liming of major mortality so that it is out of phase with resource depletion or peak predation pressure. Additional mortality peaks may occur in systems where populations are not com­ pletely adapted to seasonal hypoxia.
Hypoxia and sedimentary processes
Penetration of o:tygen into muddy sediments by molecular cliffusion is limiled to a few millimetres (Revsbech et al. 1980). Bioturbation by infauna, such as burrowing and tube building, leads to irrigalion of the sediments and is responsible for distribution ofoxygen into deeper sediment layers (McCall & Tevesz 1982). The oxygenation effect of the burrowing shrimp Callianassa sublerranea has been shown in a long.term experiment. Over a three­ month period the bioturbating activity of this species increased the redox potential so that recordings of more than 300mV were obtained on over tOO occasions (Forster & Graf 1992). Most infauna cease or severely modify their bioturbational activities during hypoxia. Cessa­ tion of feeding, emergence from the sediment, and shallowing of the vertical distribution are infaunal behaviour responses 10 hypoxia that aller sedimentary processes (Table 4).
Bioturbation in areas characterized by low dissolved oxygen is limited or absent. Schaff­ ner et aJ. (1992) attribU!ed the absence of bioturbation in the Himmerfjard (Swedish east coast) to hypoxia and anoxia. In Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound, depth gradients of declining bioturbation are consistently associated with deep water hypoxia or anoxia (Schaff­ ner el aI. 1987, 1992). Laminated sediments, a key indicator of lack of bioturbation, have accumulated in the persistent hypoxic/anoxic basin of the Baltic at some depths> 75m for the past 200 to 300 years. Since the 1940s the area of laminated sediments has increased and

shifts the balance of benthic-pelagic coupling by altering the cycling of nitrogen and phos­ phorus. Nitrification-deoitrificalion processes in sediments require a juxtaposition of oltic and anOJlic habitats (Jenkins & Kemp 1984. Kristensen 1988), which burrowing organisms enhance through their bioturbation and irrigation activities (Kristensen & Blackburn 1987). When such activities stop. the oxic volume of sediment declines thus reducing the rate of denitrification and increasing the flux of nitrogen to the water column. Simultaneously, anoxic sediments release more phosphorus to the water column Iban do oxidized sediments. This represents a positive feedback loop Ibat increases primary production which in tum increases the oxygen demand from the decomposition of the new organic malter. A self­ accelerating system is created !,hat perpetuates hypoxia and can lead to anoxia.
Hypoxia and energy flow
In well developed. successionally advanced communities not exposed to hypoxic stress. the cycling of energy and nutrients out of me community is minimal, usually taking the form of predation processes. This results in an overall increase in the efficiency of the h'ophic func­ tioning of the system (Odum 1981). These advanced successional communities can be main· tained through time. as shown by long-rerm benthic soodies (petersen 1915. Josefson & Jensen 1992. Rosenberg et al. 1992), if the physical environment does oat experience cata­ strophic perturbations, such as hypoJlia or anoxia. In systems lhat have long-tenn benlhic data and now experience seasonal hypoxia or anoxia, such as me Kaltegat, community organization has declined (Pearson et al. 1985, Josefson & Jensen 1992). Various functional processes wilhin these oxygen stressed systems such as nutrient cycling and energy transfer have changed drastically, for the most pan becoming more pulsed. Prior to the occurrence of hypoxia the principal pulsing force in these systems was seasonality, but hypoxia has increased the magnitude of the pulse and shortened the time interval over which it occurs.
In hypox.ia* or anoxia-stressed habitats, community organization during periods of stress tends to decline or is returned to an earlier pioneering successional stage (sensu Pearson & Rosenberg 1978). If hypoxia is aperiodic and not repetitious. thc systems seem to return to their previous level oforganization. This was me case in the New York Bight hypoxia/anoxia event of 1978. When hypoxia becomes predictable, either periodic or seasonal, the ultimate level of community organization achieved is lower than that prior to the occurrence of hypoxia, and also lower than that expected for the system considering only physical environ­ ment parameters. as is seen in the current state of the Kattegat (Josefson & Jensen 1992, Pearson & Rosenberg 1992).
Faced with very stressful hypoxic conditions. a community with a lower level of organi­ zation would be optimally poised forcapruring and processing the system's energy during the shortened time intervals when normoxia and temperature combine 10 allow rapid growth and reproduction. This energy utilization could either occur prior to or post hypoxia. Communi­ ties witll simpler organization would then be better able to respond and to rebuild strucoore and functions following a catash'ophic stress. This is, in principle, what happens in systems exposed to recurring hypoxic and anoxic stress. Recurring low oxygen stress not only halts successional development of a community but also keeps the communities in a perpetual pio­ neering state that could have mixed consequences for ecosystem energy flow (Rhoads et at. 1978). For example, the pulse of production that follows or precedes a hypoxic event can be

a temporary benefit to predators, but in the long tenn altered productivity patterns could leave predators with little resources later in lhe season.
Periodic and seasonally low oxygen stressed habitats favour genotypes that maximize energy flow to growlh and reproduction. limiting energy loss to maintenance or long-tenn stress tolerance (Odum 1971). During short-term or mild hypoxia, species exhibit plastic responses to minimize stress or sustain a temporary energy drain (Table 4). Populations using these behavioural or physiological responses cannot be sustained if lheir net reprodUC­ tion rates are consistently less than one; instead, species replacement results. In the few sys­ lems studied lhat have pre- and post·hypoxia data, benthic conununities have undergone major structural changes and species replacements. Systems that now experience seasonal hypoxia appear to pulse or focus lheir energy flow lhrough opportunistic species prior to the onset of the hypoxia, for example lhe Kattegat. Systems that experience periodic hypoxia expend more energy in stress tolerance and do not pulse wildly, for example me York River, Virginia. In all cases, the increased occurrence of hypoxia leads to communities dominated by opporrunists.
In all cases hypoxic stress represents an energy drain (Odum 1971) and as energy is lost the community changes. Sensitive taxa succumb to stress and are removed in order of sensitivity resulting in a reduction in species richness. Species changes are accompanied by changes in relative abundance of individual species and increase in dominance of a few tolerant species.
With the rerum of normoxic conditions, after a severe hypoxic or anoxic event, the organic matter fluxed into the habitat becomes available to aerobic respiration (Graf 1989). In all cases the opponunistic species come in first and utilize energy released from the pre­ vious community. This energy utilization is related to me opportunist'S adaptation to quick response to stress. The anaerobic microbes take their part but a significant part returns to the macrofauna. If this was not the case then opportunistic species would not do so well. The longer and more intense the hypoxia, the more the microbes will remineralize carbon and the smaller will be the organic maner available to support recruitment with the return of nonnoxic conditions.
The effects of hypoxia on ecosystem energy flow are less predictable than effects on com­ munity structure or succession. Response and recovery sequences for community structure following hypoxia are similar betWeen ecosystems and highly predictable. Effects on energy flow, however, vary from collapse of secondary production and extreme enhancement of bacterial populations, to no effect on production but pulsed transfer of benthic biomass to upper-level consumers.
Seasonal hypoxia or anoxia in bottom waters is a key factor in affecting secondary productivity, depending on the concentration of oxygen and the length of time a habitat is exposed. Habitats that are exposed to extensive periods of anoxia have low annual production (Rainer & Fitzhardinge 1981). The amount of productivity in these severely stressed habitats is a function of how quickly benthos can recruit and grow during periods of normoxia. In a near anoxic basin - Port Hacking, Australia - productivity was almost 16 times lower than at a nearby station that only experienced hypoxia (Rainer & Fitzhardinge 1981). Chesapeake Bay areas that experience anoxia do not seem to have as high a factor differentiating annual productivity of habitats. While some areas known to be affected by seasonal anoxia do have lower productivity, the trend is not consistent across habitat types. This results from a com­ bination of duration of exposure to anoxia and rapid recovery of benthos. Annual secondary production of Chesapeake Bay habitats known to experience only seasonal hypoxia is of the same magnitude as habitats that are always normoxic (Diaz & Schaffner 1990).
289
ROBERT J. DIAZ & RUTGER ROSENBERG
In systems that have secondary production and energy flow estimates, about 50-70% of the annual secondary infaunal production is consumed by epibenthic predators (Arntz 1981, Moller et al. 1985, Holland et al. 1987). The remaining production is used for biomass main~
tenance or is recycled within the benthos by infaunal predalOrs. As a system first experiences hypoxic mess (usually aperiodic) there is a temporary increase in the proportion of produc­ tion transferred to epibenthic predators and at the same time an increase in the importance of microbes in recycling the secondary production. Mild periodic hypoxia also pulses a higher portion of the production to predalOrs. Severe seasonal hypoxia, however, shifts a large pro­ portion of the secondary production away from epifaunal predators to microbes. In the Kat­ tegat, for example, bypoxia led 10 a 23% reduction in predation by crabs (Pearson & Rosenberg 1992). In persistent hypoxia and anoxia there is a drastic reduction in secondary production, and virtUally all o.fthe production goes to microbes.
Critical oxygen concentrations
In an earlier review Rosenberg (1980) suggested that benthic infaunal mortality will be iniliated when the oxygen concentration drops below about 2mll"1 . It appears, however, that the oxygen measurements in several of the field studies referred to in that review were made at some distance above the bottom. It is known from some studies 00rgensen 1980, Rosen­ berg & Loa 1988) that a strong gradient in oxygen concentrations often occurs close [0 the sediment surface. The actual oxygen concentration experienced by the fauna in some of the cited works may have been lower than 2 mll- l .
In the Gullmarsfjord in Sweden, benthic mortality occurred when the oxygen concentration dropped below 0.83m11-1(Iosefson & Widbom 1988). At the Texas shelf, benthic mortality was discovered at an oxygenconcemratioD of 1.1 mll~ I and mass mortality at0.5 m1r l (Harper et aL 1991). In the Kattegat a significant mortality was recorded in oxygen concentrations of 0.9-1.0mWI (14-17% saturation) (Rosenberg et aI. 1992). Bottom trawling in the Kauegat in 1988 demonstrated a mass mortality over large areas in oxygen concentrations below 1mil-I (15 %saturation) or slightly less (Baden et al. 1990a). In 0.5-O.6m11~1 Ophiura albida were seen standing on their arm tips, but in a concentration of 1.4mli"1 the behaviour appeared to be normal (Baden et aI. 1990a). Thus, these studies ofseasonaJ hypoxia suggeSt that mortality is initialed at oxygen concentrations close to 1mW l (about 15 %samration) and that mass mor~
tality is initiated at aboutO.5mll"1 (about 1% saturation). In offshore areas with permanent oxygen deficiency the benthic communities seem to be
adapted to lower oxygen concentrations. At the Volcano 7 site a high abundance community was found in stable oxygen concenrrations of O. Il-o.16m11~I, but the fauna was signifi~
cantly reduced below 0.1m11~1 (Levin et al. 1991). Off the Peruvian coast rather diverse ben­ thic communities were found in oxygen concentrations to at least 0.6mIl"I. but were reduced below O.2m11"1 (Rosenberg et aI. 1983). The higher tolerance shown by the benthic fauna in these offshore areas may be due to evolutionary adaptation to take advantage of increased organic production typically associated with the OMZ systems. In the Black Sea, with lower salinities and rates of organic production, however, the biomass and number of species are strongly reduced below an oxygen concentration of about O.7m11- 1 (Bacesco 1963).
Sediment quality is also important for reactions of the animaIs. A "suIphidic" sediment induced significant reductions in abundance and number ofspecies in an oxygen concentration of O.7mll~ I (12% saturation, 17_19D C), whereas in a parallel experiment with less sulphidic sediment the same effects were induced at about 0.4mll- I (7 % saturation, 11-13DC) (Nilsson
MARINE BENTHIC HYPOXIA
& Rosenberg 1994). Experiments with benthic animals performed with natural sediments give similar tolerance levels to hypoxia as documented in the field for seasonal hypoxia.
Concluding remarks
Hypoxia is a growing global problem. Over 35 years ago, Brongersma-Sanders (1957) documented worldwide occurrence of hypoxia and anoxia. Some of the hypoxic and anoxic systems and events she described appear to be recurring long-term situations, as in the Black Sea. Many of the European sy;tems we currently recognize as stressed by hypoxia and anoxia, however, were not mentioned by Brongersma-Sanders even though there are data eXlending back to near the turn of the century. the Skagerrak and the Baltic Sea, for example.
While hypoxic and anoxic environments have existed through geological time, their occurrence in shallow coastal and estuarine areas appears to be increasing; most likely it is being accelerated by human activities. The consequence of many human activities (i.e. eutrophication) has manifested itself many times as a problem of low dissolved oxygen at the bottom. It appears that the oxygen budget of most major estuarine and coastal ecosystems has been adversely affected mainly mrough the proce;s of eutrophication. The area of hypoxic and anoxic bottom water is even increasing within systems that historically are considered oxygen stressed. Over the past 20 years the area affected by hypoxia has dramatically increased over the nonhwest shelf of the Black Sea, the largest anoxic system on Earth. A similar shallowing of hypoxic and anoxic bottom water has occurred in the Baltic Sea and Chesapeake Bay, and in other systems around the world.
Eutrophication acts as an accelerant or enhancing factor to hypoxia and anoxia, and when coupled with adverse meteorological and hydrodynamic events, hypoxia increases in fre­ quency and severity. Many ecosystems that are now severely stressed by hypoxia appear to be near or at a threshold (Table 5). Should oxygen concentrations get slightly lower, cata­ strophic events may overcome the systems and alter the productivity base that leads to species imponant to fisheries. Examples of such events are becoming increasingly common (see Table I). At what point permanent damage will result is difficult to say. To date there is no large system that has recovered after development of persistent hypoxia or anoxia. The only exception may be small systems where point effluents have ceased and recovery was initiated from surrounding non-affecled areas (Rosenberg 1976).

The expanding occurrence of hypoxia and anoxia continues to bring about significant S1rucrural changes in benthic communities and to affect benthic-pelagic coupling. Restoring ecosystem balance and reversing the trend of increasing hypoxia and anoxia will require dealing with the global problem of coastal eutrophication and determining how to reduce nutrient input to estuarine and coastal areas.
There is no other environmenlal parameter of such ecological imponance to coastal marine ecosystems that bas changed so drastically in such a soon period as dissolved oxygen. Even if benthos and fish stocks can presently process and utilize the excess input of organic carbon reaching well ventilated bottoms, these areas experiencing hypoxia are spreading into shallower waters with increasing frequency, and have the potential to cause deleterious effects on ftsh stocks. If we do not move quickly to reduce or Slop the primary cause of low oxygen, the decomposition of excess primary production associated with eurrophication, then the productivity strucrure of our major estuarine and coastal. areas will be permanently altered. Should the input of nutrients to the sea be significantly reduced, however, and fol· lowed by increased oxygen concentrations in hypoxic/anoxic bottom water, a rapid coloni· zation is anticipated that could restore the ecosystems within a decade.
