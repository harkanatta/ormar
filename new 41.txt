3.2 Multivariate Analysis Results
3.2.1 NMDS Ordination and Environmental Correlations
Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination revealed clear temporal patterns in benthic community composition from 2013 to 2017 (stress = 0.126). The analysis, based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarities of 126 taxa across 30 samples (6 stations × 5 years), showed distinct recovery trajectories for different stations. Environmental fitting identified significant correlations with sediment characteristics (p < 0.05): organic content (r² = 0.539), fine mud <63μm (r² = 0.313), very fine particles <20μm (r² = 0.226), and medium-fine particles <125μm (r² = 0.209).
3.2.2 Community Succession Patterns
Temporal analysis revealed a clear succession pattern across the five-year period. The opportunistic species Capitella capitata strongly dominated the early recovery phase (2013: 66,225 ind. m⁻²), showing a dramatic decline over subsequent years (2014: 12,842 ind. m⁻²; 2015: 33 ind. m⁻²; 2016: 333 ind. m⁻²) until complete absence in 2017. Despite this temporal decline, C. capitata remained the most abundant species overall (35.9% of total abundance, 79,433 ind. m⁻²). The succession was characterized by a shift from C. capitata dominance to a more diverse community, with Polydora (8.56%, 18,975 ind. m⁻²) and Ophelina acuminata (8.09%, 17,912 ind. m⁻²) becoming prominent in later years. By 2017, the community was dominated by Polydora (11,908 ind. m⁻²) and Scalibregma inflatum (5,133 ind. m⁻²), with increased abundances of equilibrium species such as Macoma calcarea (4,312 ind. m⁻²) and Scoloplos armiger (3,700 ind. m⁻²).
3.2.3 Spatial Organization in NMDS Space
The NMDS ordination showed clear spatial segregation of dominant species. C. capitata was strongly associated with negative NMDS1 scores (-1.71), indicating its dominance in early succession stages, while later colonizers such as Heteromastus filiformis and Spionidae showed positive scores on both axes (NMDS1 > 0.6, NMDS2 > 0.6). A second group of species, including M. calcarea (6.23%), S. armiger (3.55%), and Abra nitida (1.16%), clustered in positive NMDS1 space but with neutral NMDS2 scores, suggesting their association with intermediate recovery stages.
3.2.4 Station Recovery Trajectories
Station trajectories varied markedly in both total length (range: 1.91-3.89 units) and net displacement (range: 0.839-2.54 units), with station A7 showing the longest recovery path and station C4 the shortest. All stations exhibited similar initial movement directions (-37° to -53°), followed by mid-period directional shifts, and showed evidence of convergence in later years. The strongest community changes occurred in earlier years, with movement magnitude decreasing over time, suggesting a gradual stabilization of community composition.

The recovery process following the hypoxic event showed remarkable spatial and temporal consistency across Kolgrafafjörður. Community composition changed predictably over time (NMDS temporal gradient: r² = 0.776, p = 0.001), with all stations exhibiting similar succession patterns despite their different locations within the fjord. Tests of multivariate dispersion revealed no significant differences in community variability either between years (F = 0.462, p = 0.763) or between stations (F = 0.509, p = 0.767), indicating an orderly, fjord-wide recovery rather than patchy or random recolonization. This structured succession was strongly linked to the processing of organic matter (r² = 0.539, p = 0.001), suggesting that the decomposition of herring biomass drove a coordinated ecosystem recovery. The consistent level of community variation throughout the study period, despite the ongoing succession, indicates a gradual replacement of species rather than dramatic shifts in community composition. This pattern of steady, predictable change supports classical ecological succession theory, where communities progress through distinct phases following disturbance, rather than experiencing chaotic or stochastic reassembly.

The succession followed a clear species replacement pattern. Initially, the opportunistic polychaete Capitella capitata dominated the community, thriving in the organic-enriched conditions (high negative correlation with NMDS1, r = -0.713). As organic matter decreased, C. capitata was gradually replaced by species typical of more stable fjord conditions, such as [Species A] and [Species B]. The final phase of recovery (2016-2017) saw the establishment of species characteristic of undisturbed fjord communities, including [Species C] and [Species D]. This steady progression of species, maintaining consistent levels of community variation throughout the study period, supports classical ecological succession theory, where communities progress through distinct phases following disturbance, rather than experiencing chaotic or stochastic reassembly.

The succession followed a clear species replacement pattern, contributing to 79.2% of the temporal community changes. Initially, the opportunistic polychaete Capitella capitata dominated the community with extremely high abundances (early average: 6,580 ind/m²), thriving in the organic-enriched conditions. As organic matter decreased (r² = 0.539, p = 0.001), C. capitata declined dramatically (late average: 27.6 ind/m²) and was gradually replaced by a more diverse assemblage. The transition phase saw the emergence of Spionidae (particularly Polydora) and Tubificoides kozloffi. By 2016-2017, the community showed signs of returning to pre-disturbance composition, with several species characteristic of the 1999 baseline community becoming abundant, including Polydora (1,420 ind/m²), Macoma calcarea (735.6 ind/m²), and Scalibregma inflatum (498.9 ind/m²). However, some historically dominant species from 1999, such as Ennucula tenuis and Terebellides stroemii, had not yet reached their former abundance levels, suggesting ongoing recovery. This steady progression of species, maintaining consistent levels of community variation throughout the study period, supports classical ecological succession theory, where communities progress through distinct phases following disturbance, rather than experiencing chaotic or stochastic reassembly.




### 3.3.3 SIMPER Analysis

The SIMPER analysis revealed distinct temporal patterns in species contributions to community dissimilarity during the recovery period (2013-2017). The opportunistic species Capitella capitata dominated the early post-disturbance community in 2013, contributing 67.15% to the dissimilarity between 2013 and 2014, with a substantial decrease in density from approximately 66,225 to 12,842 individuals/m².

| Species | 2013 | 2014 | % Contrib. | 2014 | 2015 | % Contrib. | 2015 | 2016 | % Contrib. | 2016 | 2017 | % Contrib. |
|---------|------|------|------------|------|------|------------|------|------|------------|------|------|------------|
| Capitella capitata | 66,225 | 12,842 | 67.15 | 12,842 | 34 | 29.62 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Polydora | - | - | - | - | - | - | 3,458 | 10,217 | 8.34 | 10,217 | 16,975 | 14.97 |
| Ophelina acuminata | - | - | - | 0 | 3,517 | 7.83 | 7,617 | 15,233 | 17.29 | 15,233 | 7,296 | 14.32 |

During the initial recovery phase (2014-2015), the community showed a more balanced contribution pattern, with C. capitata's contribution decreasing to 29.62%. This period saw the emergence of less opportunistic species, with Macoma calcarea (9.71%) and Ophelina acuminata (7.83%) among the top contributors to community dissimilarity.

The later recovery phase (2016-2017) exhibited further community stabilization, characterized by increased contributions from species typically associated with less disturbed conditions. Notable species included Polydora (15.02%), Ophelina acuminata (14.93%), and Spio (12.83%), indicating a shift towards a more diverse and stable community structure.

While comparisons with the 1999 baseline data should be interpreted with caution due to different sampling methodologies, they provide context for understanding the magnitude of community change. The dramatic shift from 1999 to 2013 was primarily driven by C. capitata (46.89% contribution), reflecting the community's response to the hypoxic event. By 2017, the community composition showed signs of recovery, though differences from the 1999 baseline remained, particularly in the relative abundances of key species.
